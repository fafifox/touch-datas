They would regularly go down and attack the villages, abducting the weakest inhabitants. Once back in their caves, they would immediately devour them.</p>\n<p>Those who survived that dark era will not deny that the Crocodyls deserved their spot atop the food chain.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Yet despite their relative intelligence, they were still only animals. Mounting an ambush and conducting large-scale attacks were beyond them, which kept them from posing a risk to any but the smallest villages. Ancient stories claim that this wasn't always so, but they were considered to be fables intended to scare children.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One day <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span> was born, son of <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Grougalorasalar the Dark,</span> a black dragon who had been charmed by the reptilian beauty of <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocabulia,</span> Crocoburio's mother. This abomination, this violation of the natural order, made possible by his father's evil powers, had serious consequences for the pack.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While it normally takes three or four years for a Crocodyl to reach its adult size, <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span>, by the age of just a few weeks, had already killed all the males.</p>\n<p>The first unexpected consequence of this massacre was that it brought an end to the slaughters in the surrounding villages. But the bards may have been too hasty in writing passionate odes to heroes who, it was thought, had given their lives to eliminate the threat, for the respite was to be short-lived.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Five years passed without a single worry about the Crocodyls. It was a peaceful and pleasant time, but like all such times, it was only the calm before the storm.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio,</span> now in his prime, seemed to have a plan... for Crocodyls, that was a first. The draconic blood running through his veins gave him incredible intelligence, strength, vitality, and a worrying amount of ambition. Over a period of a few months, <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span> mated with all the females, who then provided him with sons as cruel as their father, and ready to obey his every order.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span> knew that there was something missing that his powers were unable to give him. To the east, Amakna's heroes had terrifying weapons that were capable of blowing him and his sons to pieces. So he decided to pay his father, <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Grougalorasalar,</span> a visit.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Dragons are notorious for being particularly unpleasant hosts, even to their own offspring. And had <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span> been in the den of any other dragon, he would most certainly have had a difficult time of it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Grougalorasalar</span> was enticed by the spite he saw in his son's eyes, just like he had been enticed by the dark beauty of <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocabulia.</span> They stayed in the cold, humid cave for a long time, scrutinising one another. They seemed to understand each other without saying a word. Even if none of the legends can reveal what <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span> promised his father, we know that it was on this day that his father gave him the legendary <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocobur</span> sword.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This sword forged in the fires of a volcano was not only a true work of art; it was also a magical weapon with devastating powers. Grougalorasalar used the darkest sorcery to strengthen his powers; protection runes were engraved on the blade Crocobur, and a regenerative gem was embedded into the quillon to ensure its bearer unfailing longevity.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"285\" height=\"343\" src=\"##png,95##\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While we may not know exactly what happened that day, we know that after this meeting, the black dragon, the devilish destroyer of life and infernal scourge of the living, was transformed. He had grown fond and proud of his son and began watching his progress from a distance, intervening any time Crocoburio attacked anyone stronger than him, fell into a trap, or was betrayed.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>This love, which grew stronger every day, was inexplicable in a black dragon with the darkest of dark hearts. It was likely <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio's</span> unique character and his all-consuming, unlimited hatred that his father liked so much. Once when <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span> ravaged and seized control of the \"green lands\", the black dragon accompanied his son, and spoke words of advice and encouragement from the shadows where he hid.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio's</span> territory had spread out as far as the borders of Amakna and many believed it would be the end of the civilised world.</p>\n<p>None of the heroes that tried to oppose him were able to defeat this terrible warlord. He wiped out numerous villages, enslaved the villagers, and was about to march on Bonta, when fate decided to turn the tables on him.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>An immense white dragon called <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Croulaklakoss</span> had been watching <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span> for a while, and above all had been keeping a close watch on <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Grougalorasalar's</span> dark deeds for the last several thousand years.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As a rule, dragons are not really concerned with other species or their fate; they find them about as noteworthy as Tofus. However, amongst the dragons themselves, black and white have feuded and envied each other's treasures since the dawn of time itself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio</span> and <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Grougalorasalar</span> set off to attack the great Bonta, the shrewd and calculating <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Croulaklakoss</span> descended on them and attacked the black dragon directly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The battle between the two scaly monsters made the ground shake as if in fear, and many in the Crocodyls' ranks were massacred.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Thinking they were being helped by the white dragon, the knights and city defenders threw themselves into the battle, spelling the end of the reptilian army.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bontarian archers' arrows pierced <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crocoburio's</span> skin like a sieve. He fell, fatally wounded, killing dozens of enemies in the process.</p>\n<p>Seeing his offspring struck down, <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Grougalorasalar</span> was distracted for an instant. The white dragon took advantage of the momentary lapse to deliver him a final, fatal blow. <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Grougalorasalar</span> fell with a crash, his enormous head landing next to his son's lifeless body.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To this day, the elders tell how they saw, for the first time in Amaknian history, an incredible thing which seemed all the more incredible for a creature with a soul as dark as a Bwork's foot: they saw a dragon cry as it died.

That year, the frost had arrived much earlier and more fiercely than in years past. The trees of the neighbouring forest had been layered with thick snow for some time.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>If the cold, biting as it was, was to be their only challenge this winter, they should make it through unscathed. The Fecas in this region were farsighted and hard-working, so every year they would fill several barns to the brim with grain and supplies to ensure they would make it though the cold season without too much hardship. They were so well organised that, though the winter was particularly glacial, they never had anything to fear.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the harvest had been particularly meagre that year. Yet there wasn't much panic; they had still gathered enough food and wood to keep themselves warm during the winter without starving, if only just.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"465\" height=\"630\" src=\"##png,104##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Yet, as if the uncommonly meagre harvest were an ill omen, many had begun to worry.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How they would have loved to be wrong... but that night was a terrible one. Blood-curdling howls could be heard throughout the night. At first, they thought it was common wolves, as was often the case in the region, but the howls, interspersed with tortured screams, were so powerful, so like sinister laughs, that they all knew it could only be one thing. A Boowolf had come to the forest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That night, all the inhabitants were gathered in the village hall. It was the most horrible night of their life. Fathers tried unconvincingly to soothe their wives and children but sheer terror was easy to read in everyone's eyes.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>But the worst was yet to come. With the first light of dawn the screams stopped, and the bravest of the few hunters in the village went outside to discover a sight they would never be able to forget...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The lifeless, disembowelled corpses of dozens of wolves and other creatures littered the village square. It was a scene of pure horror, even for the most jaded of the hunters.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And yet, the worst was still to come... The barns containing the winter reserves had been sacked and burnt to the ground, all of them, without exception. Not even a single grain remained to feed the inhabitants through the winter.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once the square had been cleaned up, the village regained some semblance of calm. A sinister calm...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>A special, urgent meeting was held between the elders of the village and it was decided that a group with the best fighters of the village would depart as soon as possible to seek help in the nearest city. They were to hire mercenaries to come rescue the remaining villagers and take them far, far away to safety.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With luck, they might have succeeded. But luck was not with them. All of the hunters expected to have to fight the Boowolf, and none were surprised when it found them. What they did not expect, and what was a very unhappy surprise indeed, was that it was not alone. There were three gigantic Boowolves to contend with. The fight didn't last long at all. The three Boowolves brought down the poor Fecas with ease...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Only one man among the hunters survived his wounds. He was the youngest and his name has been forgotten with the passing of time. Many hours after the Boowolves had left the villagers dead or dying, the young hunter managed to get up again and, with the help of a simple stick, walked until night fell. Fate or blind luck led him to a small cabin that he had never seen before, deep in the middle of the forest. Tentatively, he knocked on the door with the end of his stick.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>An old Enutrof, dressed all in white, opened the door. He immediately understood: the young Feca was dying.

And yet, he couldn't bring himself to do nothing and let so many women and children die.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the morning, he got up and, strangely calm yet determined, filled his sled with supplies. He harnessed his two white Tabis, <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Reindear</span> and <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Rudolf</span>. He gathered enough supplies for a hundred people to live for a year. He took all he had gathered during his lifetime, and left nothing behind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not once did he look back.

As it did, he suddenly began to recall the words of his dear, departed grandma, recounting an ancient legend:</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>\"In the beginning, the Krosmoz was created. This has widely been regarded as a good move. Shortly after, the ancient gods entrusted the care of Amakna to two gods: Doodoo and Booboo. Unfortunately, Doodoo spent much of his time murmuring soft, incomprehensible words into his beard, despite many reprimands from an apoplectic Booboo, who spent his own time crying, without stop, \"B-b-b-but this is impossible! How c-c-c-can one p-p-p-person be so dumb?!\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><i>(Archivist's note: part of Cdrik's manuscript has been erased, so the following section relates the events narrated in the original text.)</i></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>The endless bickering of the two gods eventually separated the Earth from Sky. The Earth would henceforth to be ruled by Gallia, and the Sky by the five Fromskys. Betty, Babar, Noel, Quentin, and Sandra Fromsky all had fabulous magical powers. Yet, Noel stood out from the rest of his family. Indeed, he alone had the ability to bring things to life, which made his siblings quite envious of his power.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Noel used his gift to create nine beings: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen, and Rudolph. Filled with extreme jealousy, the Fromsky siblings transformed all nine into animals and exiled them to Earth, where they lived and were known as Rayndears. Noel discovered their treachery and decided to join the Rayndears in exile. The Rayndears had kept their ability to fly through the skies, and proudly pulled the sled belonging to their creator, Noel.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Legend says that Noel took up residence in a cave north of Amakna, hiding from his siblings who set off after him, and there he discovered eggs with strange powers: the Dofus.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p><i>(Archivist's note: the original manuscript continues faithfully from this page on.)</i></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Strange things began happening: ten of the eggs began to move, and ten beings sprung from them, each possessing twenty or so unique magical powers. The progenitor of each of the races had been born. Noel named them Sadida, Osamodas, Enutrof, Sram, Xelor, Ecaflip, Eniripsa, Iop, Cra, and Feca. Xelor could bend and warp time at will; Eniripsa knew the most ancient of healing secrets; Osamodas had an incredible empathetic connection with other living beings; Cra could see perfectly at incredible distances...</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Each of the ancients had their own unique powers. Noel then invented a machine which could create dozens of creatures in the image of the country's first inhabitants.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The remaining four great Fromskys still didn't know where Noel was hiding, but they caught wind of his discoveries and saw the country of Ankama fill up with these beings that were so small compared to them.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>They then set about trying to create life themselves. It was not a total failure. They brought many beings to life, but their creations could not match the intelligent, social and developed creations Noel had made.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>These creations loved the Earth, and some suffered so much that they became aggressive and shut themselves in caves, hid in forests, or secreted themselves away on islands.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>One moonless night, some of the creatures, which would later become known as Wabbits, spied something strange and shiny while digging their den.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It was round, or rather, oval, and had coloured spots all around; it seemed fragile and just a little worse for wear.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>The Fromskys, attracted by the fuss and chaos of this part of the land, quickly discovered the cause of this disruption and took the object in question. They had just acquired one of the rare Dofus of the land. They quickly understood the power it contained and decided to use it to create a being, as Noel had done so long ago. But they had neither his know-how nor his ever so unique power.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Nonetheless, a new creature was created. It easily surpassed all the things the Fromskys had created before. Intellectually, it was equal to Noel's beings, but its genetic code was troubled and unstable. Creatures in its image would come to be known as Sacriers.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Noel realised the gravity of the situation: such an event must imperatively be prevented from happening again. He tasked his flying Rayndears to travel the lands and gather all the Dofus they could find.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>When all the Dofus had been collected and were in his possession, he had a brilliant idea! Indeed, the Dofus more and more urgently needed to be hidden, and so he thought of the only places in the land that the Fromskys would never think to search. He entrusted the Dofus to the Fromskys' most powerful and terrifying creatures: Dragon Pig, Wa Wabbit, Dark Vlad, and many more.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>From that day on, the Sacriers learned to overcome their difficulties and control their power to make good use of it, and Noel has never stopped taking care of every being living in the lands of Amakna.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>To commemorate Noel's affection for his creatures, Gallia, who governed the Earth, planted a giant tree, the Rif-Salguod that bore strange red spherical fruits all year round, and each each fruit reflected the life of one of Amakna's beings.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<p>Noel placed a star that he had brought with him atop the tree, and decreed that he must visit each and every one of these creatures at least once a year. He chose the month of Descendre for this excursion to Amakna; meanwhile Noel's Rif-Salguod continued to grow, surrounded by thousands of smaller Rif-Salguods created by Gallia to keep the original hidden.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Every year, Noel travels the land, offering gifts to every creature. For example, it is said that Noel, after having given him a castle, gave Wa Wabbit powerful robots, called Wobots, to protect him...\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>A strange event pulled Kevin from his thoughts: the bright light had gone out for a moment, and then stopped growing and, worse yet, began to fall! It fell a long time before coming to a stop with a dull thud. It lit up all the strange, pointed trees that grew each year around that time, the very same trees that local lumberjacks absolutely adored cutting down so that the locals could each decorate one with all sorts of shiny objects.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Was the tale true? If it was, had Noel himself fallen in the middle of the forest, or just his star? Intrigued by the scintillating light filling the forest, Kevin immediately headed out towards the mysterious object. After a long and exhausting trek, the light became difficult to bear, and for good reason: he was nearing the site of the impact.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>When he arrived, he discovered a great man; Noel, his creator and father, was there in front of him!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Noel was stuck there because a leather part on his sleigh, without which flight was impossible, had been damaged.</p>\n<p>Kevin, having some knowledge of leather-working, was able to repair the sleigh, and Noel left again, calling out: \"Thanks, Kevin!\" That year, Noel was able to continue his rounds, and to show his gratitude, he gave Kevin a gift that only Eniripsas can master: flight. Kevin could thus fly through the air.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>It's said that anyone who visits the crash site will discover something marvellous, beyond their wildest hopes and dreams.</p>\n<br> <p>Unfortunately, the exact location has been forgotten by all, and no one, not even young Kevin, knows how to get there...

The forest was no longer strong enough to take a stand, and the Treechnids gradually disappeared.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, north-west of Amakna, one part of the forest remained intact.

Though his story is often compared to a fairy tale, even his fiercest detractors agree that all the witness accounts have an obvious thing in common... an anomaly which can't be explained by the most brilliant magicians, nor by the scholars of Bradacho, nor by the followers of Radama.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We believe that the story of the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Cruncher</span>, if he exists, is linked to the story of a young man called <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary Asp</span>, son of the renowned <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zelote Asp</span>.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>That is why we are now going to examine what pushed <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary</span> to walk all the way to Mount Stinkky.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary</span>, who is probably considered to be the most empiricist of all the magicians of Amakna, is like the angel Baloisse who only believes what he sees. He had decided to prove to the world, once and for all, that the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Cruncher</span> was a pure fabrication, a tale for the gullible...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The reason for this surprising obsession came about in quite an informal way, in the doorway of Glow-Finger Tavern, an indecent bar where all encounters between magicians and witches were possible. Magicians looking for a good time generally met there...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>But that wasn't why <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary</span> was there. Glow-Finger Tavern was the sanctuary of <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Maly the Bogeywoman</span> and of the many young mages whose hearts she had stolen...</p>\n<p>After a pretty boozy evening, tired of the young magus's statements, <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Maly the Bogeywoman</span> promised her hand \"and more\" to <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> if he would give her the key to solving the enigma of the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Cruncher</span> – either proof of his existence, or of his nonexistence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Women are often cruel to their suitors. And giving <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary</span> this challenge was about the same as asking him to stand still for several hours, on the head of a bucking Minotoror... though this is not a good example because a magician has already done that.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"465\" height=\"600\" src=\"##png,97##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>But the young and crazy <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> was delighted and found that it was worth the trouble to earn unlimited access to the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Bogeywoman</span>'s favours.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is why our young magus began his journey, with a bundle on his shoulder and romantic dreams in his head. He then headed for Mount Stinkky in order to meet the first witnesses to have been in contact with the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Cruncher</span>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Anyway, it wasn't an easy thing to get to the place where those people lived... It was a long and dangerous journey... The only advantage was that all the humans who are said to have met the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Cruncher</span> were all gathered in that very place...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary</span> had to go there. And this fact alone, when you think about it, deserves to be told for everything he had to endure and the obstacles he had to face. However, this has nothing to do with the real purpose of this book.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This asylum was very hard to reach since they only brought nutcases and crackpots of the worst kind over there. If any of them escaped, you had to make sure that they wouldn't be able to get past the numerous traps.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>They all had something in common... a thing that made those most resistant to the idea of the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Cruncher</span>'s existence doubt their certainty... a lousy doubt that prevented them from closing the books.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All the witnesses had a liking for evil: lechers, perverts, Api eaters, nuddle burners... Each victim had a strong vice and some unhealthy deeds weighing on their conscience. However, they probably all ended up in this big asylum on Mount Stinkky either because they went mad after seeing the creature or because they deserved a reprimand for their deeds.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The only thing we need to know is that, when he arrived in this terrible building, our young <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> was still smiling, and he still had images of the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Bogeywoman</span> in his head, as if his love for the saucy girl had given him an iron and steadfast will, even in the most difficult of times...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span>, who had barely taken the time to look after his wounds, went and questioned <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Damog the Loony</span>, a famous brewer who mixed his beer with Tofu blood. The hatred he had of these little animals had brought about the downfall of numerous families of breeders and, to crown it all, had turned his beer into one of the most famous in Amakna. Of course, this was before the consumers realised what they were drinking. Some bars still serve it, but <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Damog</span> was confined to a mental hospital. The specialists considered him mad and dangerous.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>But to <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span>'s great displeasure, <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Damog</span> wasn't paying attention to his visitor. He kept saying these words \"More in me... More in me...\" <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> was all the more troubled since all the other people who could have given him some information behaved exactly the same way... Whether it was <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Jango the Ripper</span> or <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Farde the Frivolous</span>, they all kept saying the same words, with the same intonation...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All but one.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"465\" height=\"650\" src=\"##png,98##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Just when he had lost hope, <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> went to see the last witness. Probably the most terrible. A tall, bald-headed man with weird eyes... big and protruding, frightening and penetrating eyes as if they were reading the soul of their interlocutor. <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> wasn't really scared, because he hadn't made this trip and survived all those adventures to be frightened by two big eyes... Oh no, it would take more than that for him to forget <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Maly the Bogeywoman</span>'s charms...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>His name was <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Molok Ark</span> and, unlike his \"roommates\", he wasn't repeating this sentence over and over... He was surprisingly quiet. And, believe it or not, this quietness was terrible.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>When he spoke, it was with a surprisingly guttural voice, a voice that didn't sound human at all. <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> would have certainly turned tail and ran, but the thought of winning <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Maly</span>'s favours was enough to keep him to task. But this simple \"hello\" would certainly have frozen the blood of even the god <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Iop</span> himself.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary</span> spoke up, with a slightly quivering voice, and asked his interlocutor about a thousand questions. <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> was looking for a detail, a hint that would prove that the legend was ridiculous.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span> the empiricist didn't care much whether the monster existed or not, his desire was now too strong for him to waste anymore time around here. Every second he was wasting here was a precious second wasted far from his muse.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>When, suddenly, <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Molok</span> started speaking. His voice had changed, it sounded younger, softer... \"Kiss me, <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary</span>, kiss me and I'll give you the proof you seek; kiss me and your quest will be over.\" That is what he said.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span>, who couldn't believe it, pondered for a moment... He had never believed this nonsense story, and what was wrong with kissing a mad man if it enabled him to have the woman of his dreams and earn himself a good reputation in the academy to boot.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This poor chained bugger couldn't possibly harm him. He walked slowly towards him, with a grin, took <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Molok</span>'s head in his hands and heartily kissed this terrible person, renowned as one of the most terrible gangsters and murderers in Amakna.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The guards opened their eyes again several hours later. They explained that when <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zak</span>'s lips touched <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Molok</span>'s, a terrible flash of light lit up the room. When they awoke, <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Zakary Asp</span> had disappeared, and <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Molok</span>, hunched up in a corner, kept saying \"More in me... More in me...\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Collective hallucination? Whatever it was, we still have not managed to prove that the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Cruncher</span> exists...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet, a few days later, <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Maly the Bogeywoman</span> disappeared as well.

Why would a wind carrying such powerful magic suddenly begin to blow? Why precisely at that time? Why? The only logical explanation in such an illogical context must involve one of the other great non sequiturs of our world: the Dofus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In short, in order to explain this mystery, I've no recourse save to press into service another mystery. It would seem to me that someone assembled the four elemental Dofus. Their interaction at that moment created a whirlpool of pure elemental magic that propagated throughout the land – and the breeze began to blow.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Let us now move on to the topic at hand: the creation of magical items.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Elemental magic, carried on the Quadramental Breeze, can be isolated, stockpiled, and manipulated. With suitable tools, one may even impregnate certain items. But this manipulation is difficult, and most assuredly not without risk.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let us examine, step by step, the transformation of an item by elemental magic.</p>\n<p>First of all, we will see how to harvest and work the elemental magic such that it is suited for the task of impregnating an item.</p>\n<p>Then, we shall see, in detail, the process of fusing the mundane with the magical.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It is important to know that elemental magic is usable in multiple forms.</p>\n<p>The easiest is the concentrated form contained in a sphere, which I call a Metaria.</p>\n<p>In appearance, a Metaria is a homogeneous liquid with magical properties, contained within a sphere made out of a membrane through which magic cannot pass, which prevents the magic from dissipating in the air as it normally would.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are four distinct types of Metaria, each corresponding to a specific element:</p>\n<p>– Yellow Metaria: Earth</p>\n<p>– Green Metaria: Air</p>\n<p>– Blue Metaria: Water</p>\n<p>– Red Metaria: Fire</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There are also three degrees of magic concentration (percentages given are in comparison with a sample of pure magic):</p>\n<p>– Simple Metaria: 50%</p>\n<p>– Triam Metaria: 65%</p>\n<p>– Mage Metaria: 80%</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>You may find pure Metaria in the entrails of certain monsters, in particular those monsters with some level of elemental potential.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can also craft them. To do so, it is necessary to press and compress several magic-containing resources in one of the \"Munster Mashers\" that I've created. You must then collect the resulting magic liquid in a \"Munster Magic-Catching\" bowl.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Here is the list of current resources that give good results:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Metaria:</span></p>\n<p>4 × Kwak feathers + 1 × Kwak beak + 1 × Metaria sphere</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Triam Metaria:</span></p>\n<p>4 × Scaraleaf antennae + 1 × Scaraleaf wings + 1 × Metaria sphere</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Mage Metaria:</span></p>\n<p>4 × Dreggon shells + 1 × Dreggon egg + 1 × Metaria sphere</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>But how exactly do we use Metaria to impregnate an object? We can't – at least not directly.</p>\n<p>You must work the magic contained in the sphere, mix it, and fuse it with inter-ether liquids in order to give it stability in our physical world (I shan't trouble you with the details – suffice it to say that only alchemists can fully understand this process).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Take your Metaria to an alchemist to be transformed into potions. And now nothing remains to be done save to impregnate your metal with magic!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Fusing metals and weapons is straightforward:</p>\n<p>A single elemental potion will suffice for each weapon.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Place your weapon on the specially-constructed anvil, heat it to a temperature at which metal may fuse, and once the weapon glows red, plunge it quickly into the elemental liquid. Repeat several times.

Instead, we're going to look at the second most important condition: proper feeding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This book will first explain the importance of the Bwak feeding cycle. It will then cover the resources that make up its diet.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Feeding Your Pet</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A well-fed pet is a <span class='document_content2_fr-class9'>regularly</span>-fed pet!</p>\n<p>It takes Bwaks a minimum of 12 hours to digest food. Forcing one to ingest something before it has finished digesting will make it obese and slowly damage its health. The best way to feed one is to follow a fixed daily schedule.</p>\n<p>For example, at 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But remember that 12 hours is its <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>minimum</span> digestion period. Once a Bwak has finished digesting its food, it can easily go about 10 hours before being hungry again.</p>\n<p>That's why scheduled feedings every 24 hours would be quite appropriate for a Bwak.</p>\n<p>For example, at 9 a.m. every day.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Generally, Bwaks can fast for about 36 hours.</p>\n<p>After that, your Bwak's health will begin to decline rapidly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you follow this diet to the letter, your Bwak will thrive. Statistically, you will notice visible improvement approximately every 3 meals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you don't feed your Bwak enough, it will become weak and skinny.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you feed it too much, it will become obese.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Therefore, you must be very careful.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Treating Malnutrition</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your pet becomes obese, you can treat it by following the proper feeding schedule. Alternatively, you could deprive it of food until it returns to its normal state, but be careful as this last method could make your pet suffer and fall ill.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your pet gets skinny, you can ignore normal meal times until it recovers its strength.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Treating Injuries</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When injured, your pet will need to follow a special diet of Eniripsa Powder, which can be used to heal pets. You can purchase this powder from the Bow Kennel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If your pet is injured, you can also bring it to the Bow Kennel to keep its condition from worsening until you can get Eniripsa Powder for it.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Your Bwak's Diet</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Bwaks can eat many kinds of resources. Some will provide the vitamins needed to improve resistance, while others will have different effects.</p>\n<p>Please find a non-exhaustive list of these foods below:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Most <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>seeds</span> will reinforce its basic characteristics.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Nuts</span> will strengthen its resistance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Acorns</span> will reinforce its stamina.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Using Your Pet in Combat</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your pet will typically help you in combat by defending you or helping to make your attacks more effective.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Be sure to keep a close eye on your pet, though, because it will be injured every time you lose a fight against a creature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you don't heal it after each loss, it will eventually die, and you'll have to find a way to revive your pet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, the only way to heal a pet after losing a battle is to feed it Eniripsa Powder.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Customarily, when adventurers fight one another, pets are never targeted and therefore cannot be injured, even in the event of defeat.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to be sure your pet doesn't get injured, simply keep it in your inventory rather than having it by your side during combat.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>About the Bow Kennel</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bow Kennel is a place generally reserved for raising pets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can leave your pet there so it's safe and well-fed while you are away. However, your pet will not improve while in the Bow Kennel, as it is away from its master.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You typically have to pay a fee to drop off your pet, and then another fee when you pick it up later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The amount you have to pay will depend on how long you're gone for. The longer your pet stays in the Bow Kennel, the steeper the fee.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The Bow Kennel is also where you can buy Eniripsa Powder to heal your pet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most well-known Bow Kennel is usually marked on adventurers' maps. It can be found next to Sufokia Gate.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>In conclusion, we must point out a physical limit to your Bwak's constitution.</p>\n<p>Once its growth is complete, its capacities will have reached their maximum and it will be difficult to improve it further.</p>\n<p>But be advised: if you stop caring for your Bwak properly once it has reached this state, its health will suffer greatly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck to you and your pet!</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\n.document_content2_de-class8 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class9 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_de-class9 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class9 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class8 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"46":{"id":46,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Bow Meow","authorId":"<b>Oshimo Bigglip</b>","subTitleId":"How to raise your favourite pet","contentId":"<p>Preface: p. 3</p>\n<p>Introduction: p. 5</p>\n<p>Feeding Your Pet: p. 6</p>\n<p>Treating Malnutrition: p.8</p>\n<p>Treating Injuries: p. 9</p>\n<p>Your Bow Meow's Diet: p. 10</p>\n<p>Using Your Pet in Combat: p. 11</p>\n<p>About the Bow Kennel: p. 13</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Preface</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as happens every year, a new type of Black Plague ravaged Amakna.

Reader, you will understand that the world described in these lines is far from one void of history.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"465\" height=\"620\" src=\"##png,101##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Preface</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>As a prologue to this story, you should know that a single god is not enough to create a world worthy of the name. However, the world in question owes much to Osamodas, a moody god who prefers the company of animals to that of the other gods. Some say he specialised in animal Summons to keep himself company... which benefits his followers: Osamodas's disciples can summon the most beautiful representatives of Amaknian fauna – from Tofus, the slender birds with yellow feathers, and Gobballs, the gracious herbivores with white wool, to Prespics, the blubbery beasts whose stings make even the toughest people cry out in pain.</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>During one of his lonesome strolls, the god Osamodas came face to face with a strange sign. From this find, and thanks to the god's dragons, a new world was born.</span></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"There's nothing here.\" Written in fiery letters on a platinum sign, the words flash in turn; they seem to float in the middle of nowhere. Around the panel, a cold, bleak star gravitates, thrown across the vacuum of space like so many others. Moreover, reading this sign is the only thing to do there – yet it's still necessary to be a god, a god called Osamodas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Treading the vacuum of space with his divine feet, nevertheless swollen by the long walk he'd just undertaken, Osamodas admired the void surrounding him. It's so different from the other voids he knows! A void that's so pure, so limitless, is not to be found every day, neither amongst those around him, nor even in the god Iop's head. This flash of humour enchanted an Osamodas full of self-satisfaction. In his eyes, the god Iop was the most fiery, impetuous being, but also the most brutal of the Universe.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It's sure and proven that Iop – who juggles with still-beating hearts for breakfast, who breaks dragons' backs as if they were twigs – regularly makes the god Osamodas grind his teeth, sharp as they may be (Iop admittedly does have a rather personal sense of humour). They previously left each other a few fragments of millennial dust on these words:</p>\n<p>\"Osamodas, tell me... Is it true that your divine self is naked under those rags?\"</p>\n<p>In actual fact, Osamodas and his disciples are dressed in authentic training clothing cut from the hides of their enemies... And there's not an ounce of funny stuff about that, at least in the eyes of the gods. It was enough to stifle a long sigh.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It was therefore a first-rate vacuum of space, the likes of which are come across once during a cosmic existence, that stretched out before Osamodas's eyes. The void. A sign. A star gravitating around the sign in a corner of the universe that was completely unknown to him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's hardly surprising: he'd had to walk for a long time to dispel the god Iop's humour. As usual, he'd set off alone, surrounded by his three dragons. But this time, he could feel that an unusual elation accompanied him and his beasts. He was experiencing the omen of events that were to remain etched into cosmic history. He was right!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Helioboros, his white dragon, and Ouronigride, his black dragon, were both in an impulsive mood, and flying through space in pursuit of one another, quite a terrifying spectacle for anyone who wasn't accustomed to it. Spiritia, the multicoloured dragon, stayed on his shoulder, whistling through his thick lips a melody well known amongst multicoloured dragons. If the surroundings hadn't been so black and darkened, and so unsuitable for a game of hide and seek between dragons, the spectacle Osamodas and his creatures gave would have looked almost perky.</p>\n<p>Contemplative, Osamodas leaned on the sign and inspected the fiery letters with a wary eye. He was waiting for the scraps of the future that he'd just seen to crystallise in the present. The round rock revolved around him.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Suddenly, Ouronigride the Black snapped his jaws shut and a spray of dark lightning spread out into space: he'd narrowly missed the brilliant feather adorning Helioboros's tail... Still, a few strands of immaculate white sparked in the black dragon's mouth. He chuckled. His only eye, wrinkled with malice, grew wide with surprise: Helioboros, furious, tried to spur his left side! To dodge, he performed a sort of caper – moreover, he was surprised that he was capable of such a preposterous but lifesaving jolt – then pirouetted with a growl. The immaculate lightning sprung from Helioboros's nostrils heated his ribs: in other words, he came close! While the white dragon was getting ready to charge once more, Ouronigride escaped towards Osamodas.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"465\" height=\"370\" src=\"##png,103##\"></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The black dragon started whirling around the rock at his master's feet, closely followed by Helioboros.</p>\n<p>Both dragons now traced out increasingly tighter circles, contracting their bodies, space, and time.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The first tried to shake off the second. They were zooming past with dizzying speed. The rock was glowing, and a muffled whistling rose from it as it warmed. It was now just incandescent magma. The molten crust was pierced, and a now-piercing whistle rose from it...</p>\n<p>It was just then that Osamodas gave Spiritia a flick.

He may well hide the fact he's a mummy, he vanishes into dust at the slightest movement. Even worse: he gets it everywhere! A truly powdery scourge, full to the brim with enough mushrooms to give you a lifelong allergy (that's Eniripsa's opinion, in any case).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Osamodas remained silent. He was thinking: <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>\"Creating many varied species, winged ones, ones with feet, ones with feathers, thrown together any old how... only to see them wiped out in a cataclysm several thousand years later, all because of a careless mistake by the god-who-picks-his-teeth-with-his-dagger-while-receiving-an-offering!

You know how I worry about souls, don't you, god Iop!?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Iop raised an eyebrow. What was up with old Osamodas? Given his mood, it'd best not to argue too much... but still! The meteorite story last time wasn't really his fault. And it was at the other end of the universe, a small nothing of a blue world. It's true that he let a whole load of roughly reptilian creatures get roasted there – that's small fry! What's more, as far as he knew, the world in question was much better off without them. In reality, Osamodas was jealous. But of what, for good heavens? Iop had already been asking himself that question for a while. He drummed the sheath of his sword somewhat phlegmatically, a sign that he was a tad irritated.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>A discomforted silence fell over the assembly of the gods! Enutrof was throwing small circles of flame vacantly and Sadida was ensuring they were sufficiently far away from his leafy headdress. Sram was still smiling (well, showing his teeth).

They shall resonate to your warrior chants, they shall welcome you to rest...\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"I like that idea! May it also be so for the disciples of Cra! They shall follow the law of the air, but also that of the earth and the white fire. Their sight shall be piercing, may they live in the treetops, the mountain peaks, or the treetops on mountain peaks!\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"I, Sadida, place my disciples under the protection of the black fire; may they serve it in return! And may they serve the black air as much! They shall feed off the water and earth, and shall live in the forests. Intelligent Sadidas, you shall create obedient creatures that are loyal and deadly. To this nascent world, I bequeath a compendium of trees, mosses and plants...\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Satisfied, Sadida snickered... And Ecaflip called out:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Ecaflips! Your spells, straight from the white earth, shall equal your strength! May mountains and forests spring up, may they be a home for you, a shelter, a battlefield commensurate with your claws!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With a hoarse voice, Enutrof said:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"They shall use the black magic... my adventurous Enutrofs... They shall have phenomenal luck... siphoned from the abysses and depths... and over their hearts I shall blow! As distant as they may be in the belly of the earth, distant from all life, they shall never break... never!\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Finally, Sram murmured:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Robbers, pilferers, shoplifters, purse snatchers, plunderers and cheaters! Srams, my disciples, I bequeath you agility and strength. I make you fast like the black air and lovers of the black earth. Its plant adornments shall conceal you, its rocky trappings shall hide you... you shall be invisible to all eyes... except mine!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Osamodas clapped:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"It's time to name this world!\" he exclaimed light-heartedly.</p>\n<p>\"Have you thought of something?\" asked Iop.</p>\n<p>\"Indeed! I found this world, which will be called 'Osamodia'!\"</p>\n<p>\"Found? Does that mean you didn't create it?\" asked Eniripsa, taken aback.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"And by what right would it bear your name?\" thundered the god Iop.</p>\n<p>\"It would be an immense privilege to grant you that! Why not 'Xelor's World' in that case?\"</p>\n<p>\"Xelor would appreciate such a gesture, god Iop, and I'd forever be grateful to you!\" proclaimed Xelor.</p>\n<p>\"I'll think about it again in a hundred thousand billion years, god Xelor,\" muttered Iop.</p>\n<p>\"'Sexifocsee' is a name that I think suits nicely,\" said Sram.</p>\n<p>\"What the...?\" choked the goddess Feca.</p>\n<p>\"The initials of each of the ten gods are brought together!\" he replied proudly.</p>\n<p>\"I might remind you this divine assembly that we already reign over other worlds... named Esscofixee and Secoxisfee...\" replied Enutrof.</p>\n<p>\"And the music of these names hurts my eardrums, god Sram,\" the goddess Cra retorted.</p>\n<p>\"And why not the 'World of Ten'?\"</p>\n<p>\"...\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Unanimously, the gods repeated \"World of Ten\". And the world was born. It now had a name, was populated with beings and creatures, and aroused the interest of the most powerful gods in the universe, promising an epic, heroic destiny – far from unremarkable, anyway.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n}\na {\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"103":{"id":103,"typeId":1,"titleId":"The Dragon Era","authorId":"<b>Acidrik Gutsplitter</b>","subTitleId":"Found Fragments: Part III","contentId":"<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Osamodas's three dragons breathed magic into the World.

It became opalescent and trembled: the dragon soul had already abandoned its celestial envelope by descending into the material world; it now abandoned its second skin, wreathed with starlight. It shook itself to make the last shreds of ether clinging to it disappear. Flesh and muscle appeared at last. For the ninth time in his celestial existence, Dardondakal, the one who would go on to be known as the Wise, was incarnated!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>He answered Helioboros, the lord of his race. The two other white souls shed their skins in turn. They set off skimming the land, taking in a gulp of air here and there; they flew over the sea, the foam streaming over their soon-to-be-scaly skin. These dragons were famous, known by the names of Croulaklakoss and Gresgaoulian. The World of Ten now had three white dragons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"A piece of night for me, a piece of underground depths for you. That leaves a piece of abyss for you...\" The shadowy colossus growled: a thick darkness seeped from his barely formed mouth. His flesh thickened slowly, and he tensed the muscles in his back to tear apart the now-slimy envelope – the remainder of his divine existence – that was hindering his movements. The two other dragon souls agreed to the division proposed by the one who would later be known as Grougalorasalar the Ashen.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>One of the souls shrieked and dived into the depths of the earth. But the other one, which had to sink into the black waters, disobeyed. It glided along the surface of the land and water, voracious... and it set off to find the only thing that attracted it on earth. Because this dragon soul, more than anything else, was hungry; it dreamt of devouring a living being's spirit...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The white and black dragons were thus incarnated.

The water became blue, the same blue as Aguabrial, its guardian; the fire glowed red in the image of Ignemikhal, the scarlet dragon; the earth was draped in green, for such are the emerald scales of Terrakourial; and the air became transparent, like the crystalline body of Aerafal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Each of these four dragons, young but already powerful, is the guardian of one of the four elements.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"104":{"id":104,"typeId":1,"titleId":"The Dofus Era","authorId":"<b>Acidrik Gutsplitter</b>","subTitleId":"Found Fragments: Part IV","contentId":"<p><i>Time passed, and mortal generations followed on, one after another.

He picked up some stellar matter, rolling it into a ball to make a kind of cosmic cushion. He sprawled on it nonchalantly, scratched his chin and said to himself: \"If only I could grow out this beard, I would look truly classy...\" Then his thoughts turned to recent events and their repercussions on the Krosmoz. He was bound to be there for a while.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>As always happened when he was thinking, his head started to itch, but on the inside. Yet there were no ideas bouncing around trying to get free, nor sudden strokes of genius. Make no mistake: Sram was a master strategist... when the time was right. Right now, though, he wasn't on top form. There were only two possible explanations. Either an black astral larva had slithered inside his skull, or else his conscience had sprung to life for some niggling reason... Just then, a voice echoed inside his cranial cavity. To tell the truth, it could barely be described as a voice: it was a murmur, or a whisper, or just a light breeze that was tickling him...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Do you know if there are any?\"</p>\n<p>\"What are you talking about?\"</p>\n<p>\"Don't play dumb! The hearts of the world! The living symbols of peace and harmony! Without them, nothing could exist... They exceed even the powers of the gods!\"</p>\n<p>\"There will be! I swear by my daggers, there will be...\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Who are you talking to, Sram?\"</p>\n<p>It was Enutrof, the dragon-god with a bright, scaly body. He had come up behind Sram and was now settling down with his wings spread out in a large semi-circle.</p>\n<p>\"It's nice of you to come and offer your wisdom here, Enutrof, but I don't need your help!\"</p>\n<p>Enutrof paid no attention to this declaration by the bony god.</p>\n<p>\"You know, I think I know what you're talking about... Guess what. Down there, right down at ground level, I saw a fire dragon and a water dragon fighting, each casting spells of its own element... I'll bet you anything that an earth dragon and an air dragon are nearby... Now, you know as well as I do that if elemental dragons choose to live in this world, it is highly likely that, soon enough, it will be home to Dofus! It would be for the best, too. Without Dofus, the world will slip into chaos...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"What do you want? The rest of us gods are at the mercy of these dragons and their good will... With all due respect, Enutrof...\"</p>\n<p>\"Indeed! Such are the laws of the Krosmoz... But before that, we need these dragons' hearts to beat with ardent love... And as far as I know, black dragons are not known for being flirtatious! They'd rather pick fights and rip one another to shreds than court or look for love. As for elemental dragons, all they want is to have fun! White dragons... Ah, I know white dragons. They're full of lofty sentiments, nobility, purity and the like, but they do not know passion... All we need is an ounce of sensuality, a single droplet of indulgence – that would do it! Without it, we could be waiting for eons for one of these dragons to give us a Dofus! And we've already waited long enough.\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Sram rested his chin on his long, slender fingers. He glanced listlessly into space, and his gaze fell upon Sadida, who was leading a horde of tiny creatures in a merry dance, hips swaying, arms swinging...</p>\n<p>\"I see one of us isn't preoccupied with the fate of the world!\" said Enutrof huffily.</p>\n<p>\"But his skills might just help us, you know...\" said Sram. \"Follow me!\"</p>\n<p>Sram and Enutrof sidled up to Sadida. The masked god continued to dance whilst watching them from the corner of his eye.</p>\n<p>\"Do you have a minute, Sadida?\"</p>\n<p>\"I'm right in the middle of a summoning ritual! I can't stop now! It's like asking the rain to stop falling!\"</p>\n<p>\"I summon things all the time and I can stop whenever I like...\" Enutrof murmured to Sram.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Yeah, but you pay no heed to nature and its cycles,\" hissed Sram in reply, before addressing Sadida out loud once again.</p>\n<p>\"O Sadida, do you want to know what we need? We need you to bewitch the dragons of the World of Ten... You must know a good enchantment to breathe some life into those bags of scales!\"</p>\n<p>\"Why would I do that?\" frowned Sadida as he danced.</p>\n<p>\"If you don't, this world might suffer the same fate as the last one... You know, the meteorite? The blue world that Osamodas was talking about?\"</p>\n<p>\"You mean the one that wasn't protected by any Dofus? Do you suppose the same thing could happen with the World of Ten? Troublesome. Troublesome indeed.\" This time, Sadida stopped dancing.</p>\n<p>\"But we could give the dragons a push in the right direction,\" said Enutrof. \"Not boasting, but I know quite a lot about draconic psychology. If you can get them to feel the noblest emotion of all, that of love, then we'll have shedloads of Dofus on our hands!\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Enutrof remained quiet for a few moments to let Sadida reflect on these words, then added:</p>\n<p>\"Maybe you could create some dolls in their image...\"</p>\n<p>\"Bewitch them to feel love...\" the leafy god murmured. \"And maybe even make a creature capable of charming dragons and bring it to life? That sounds feasible.\"</p>\n<p>\"That's what I like to hear, Sadida!\" Sram exclaimed.</p>\n<p>It didn't take long for Sadida's nimble fingers to create ten dolls with various appearances. Sadida's creatures proved to be true weapons of seduction... The god clothed each one in a tight outfit of Kralove fabric, and carefully equipped them with love rods, which had already proved highly effective on male Kraloves, who fell head over heels in love the moment they smelt their fragrance. With a little luck, Sadida told himself, the rods would have the same effect on dragons...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p> But more than that, the dolls acted as mirrors of love... When the first dragon caught sight of a doll, it paid no attention whatsoever to the iridescent Kralove skin and the love rod. Instead, it fell for the reflections of its own heart, as though the doll standing before it were none other than part of its own soul. For a creature as narcissistic as a dragon, it was a dream come true! This magical love was so strong and so pure that it was able to condense in the form of an egg.</p>\n<p>Of the ten dragons, six were seduced: one by one, they fell head over heels in love. Thus the six Primordial Dofus came into being...</p>","contentCSS":"null"},"105":{"id":105,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Xelor's Divine Clock","authorId":"<b>Acidrik Gutsplitter</b>","subTitleId":"Found Fragments - Part VI","contentId":"<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>The Divine Clock created by Xelor is set on the heartbeats of the Dofus. But Rushu, the Lord of the Demons, somehow feels he got a raw deal...</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>They all agree, Xelor will be the one to put into action the breakdown of time. He lifts up a tail of his cloak and draws his portable sandglass he always carries with him. This instrument enables him to freeze time. It can be very useful to fix the hitches of the time frame when dates are fraying to end up being devoured by Timemites and chronologies curl like the antennas of an old Tempousfouguite. When all this happens, the Time Silkworms, especially tamed by Xelor himself, spin the precious time thread which will be used to mend the rips.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Xelor decrees a truce of a couple thousands grains of sidereal dust which start dropping through the narrow neck of his sandglass. The swift passage of the Krosmoz stops for a brief moment, and there is the sound of a big croaking before disappearing.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Silence will calm down the cosmic and divine fluctuations going through the Universe. (We must say that Iop and Osamodas, and even all the gods of the World of Ten have completely opposite principles. However, there must be a celestial harmony, and a perfect divine understanding so that time passes by serenely).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If Xelor had a gong he would have rung it. But he has to accept the fact he's in the middle of nowhere and he won't ever find any gong around here. After having a look around the assembly of the gods, he fixes his attention on the stellar vault. He's absorbed by something that only he can see. And suddenly, he raises his arms up in the air in a flight of wrappings and luminous dust, which always makes the goddesses let out small cries of terror. This part of the ritual is totally useless but it makes the whole difference...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>He pinches the inert matter of the surrounding space. Then, he makes his forefinger twirl as if he were spooling an invisible thread. He undoes a cocoon of stellar matter from it. The latter immediately becomes a myriad of tiny eggs as soon changed into a cloud of golden mayflies.</p>\n<p>Mayflies, gathered side by side, are designing the body of a Clock which seemed made of a living bronze matter. In a gesture, Xelor points to the inside of the Clock and four transparent butterflies rush inside it. The magic butterflies are hitched up to the clock mechanism. After a couple flaps of wings, they go up into the air and the mechanism starts. There is a ticking sound. To make sure the Tempousfouguite butterflies are motivated and concentrate on their task, Xelor appoints a Time devourer frog as their assistant. Of course, there are some hiccups, and the devourer got more than one indigestion... but after a few adjustments, Xelor finally sets the Clock according to the pace of the heartbeats of the Dofus. It now marks out perfect seconds.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"465\" height=\"650\" src=\"##png,117##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It's now time for Xelor to seal the body of the Clock covering it with eleven purple gems. From now on, time passes. The hitching up of butterflies teased by the frog that keeps on pestering them is a great advantage. Indeed, there's no need to wind up the Clock. Of course, from time to time, a butterfly will have to be replaced but Tempousfouguites aren't lacking.</p>\n<p>The outstanding fact is that within the bowels of the Divine Clock is written every single thing happening in the world. Anything. Anywhere. Any time. Indeed, the Clock is made of divine mayflies. And each of these insects is born and dies in an instant. Then they are reborn like miniature phoenixes. This spontaneous combustion engraves each event in the heart of the Clock itself.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"465\" height=\"650\" src=\"##png,118##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Like a bulimic archive, the Clock records all the actions of everyone, from the first cry to the last breath. And when souls come out of their physical body to pay tribute to their god, a light tinkle sound can be heard...</p>\n<p>Quite happy that his Clock gives hours, minutes and seconds, Xelor decides to divide the dial into eleven months and four seasons. Summer was created to excite the blazing divinities Iop, Ecaflip and Cra; Falls to shower praise upon the goddess Feca and god Xelor; Winter to magnify the intuition of the gods Sram, Enutrof and Osamodas; and finally Spring to celebrate the serenity shown by both Eniripsa and Sadida.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Xelor's Clock is set on the regular heartbeats of the six Dofus scattered throughout the world. Each of the six eggs beats like a sleeping heart and the echo of the heartbeats is reverberating everywhere... All gods are admiring the Clock. All but one!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Tactlessness or will of the ten, Rushu, the Lord of the demons didn't get his share of time... Mad with rage, He took the Clock and scratched the gems with his claws. He scratched them so much that a twelfth month could be added. It will become Descendre, the month of the demons. Through the cracks of the stones, he put black slimy larvae so that they'd slow down the butterflies during the evil month.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>To make it fair, the gods accepted the month of Descendre. Xelor, the great spirit who created the Clock, was appointed Great Warden of Past and Present Times. He then appointed a protector for each month of the year.</p>\n<p>Rushu argued that only one of his people could prevent the larvas from rotting inside the Clock. He imposed Djaul, the great splashing boy, as the protector of the month of Descendre. The only task this demon has to do is to make dark Descendre days the longest of the year.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"344\" height=\"265\" src=\"##png,119##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>And the Clock recorded the following list of the protectors appointed by the gods:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Solar</span>, human hero, master of cuttings, protector of Flovor.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Silvosse</span>, human hero, master of cuttings, protector of Flovor.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Menalt</span>, centaur warrior of the Order of the Valiant Heart, protector of Martalo.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Silouate</span>, the Minotoror, protector of Aperirel.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Rosal</span>, master of flowers, protector of Maysial.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Sumens</span>, devotee of god Enutrof, protector of Junssidor.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Hecate</span>, female minor demon, protector of Jullier.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Pouchecot</span>the fruitcake, protector of Frauguctor.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Raval</span>the terrible, protector of Septangel.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Maïmane</span>the stabilizer, protector of Octolliard.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Brumaire</span>, the Dark Bleeder, protector of Novamaire.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Djaul</span>, demon, follower of Rushu, protector of Descendre.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class8 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class8 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class7 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n"},"106":{"id":106,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Birth of Bolgrot","authorId":"<b>Acidrik Gutsplitter</b>","subTitleId":"Found Fragments: Other Legends","contentId":"<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Among all lore and legends, one deserves to be mentioned here: the misadventure of Aguabrial.

They all carried out their duties with nothing less than zeal. Only one among them was consumed with venom and envy: Djaul, the demon appointed by Rushu. He was an aggressive sort, and although the other protectors tolerated his presence, they never showed him any mark of respect. Indeed, some even thought him a usurper. Only Brumaire seemed not to despise him. As for Maimane and what he had said about temperance, it rankled the demon to no end! The protector of Descendre thus wandered the World of Ten alone. Each second passed under the watch of another protector only stoked the coals of his hatred. In his wanderings, he came to know the habits of each and every one of the world's creatures.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Quite fond of souls and the secrets they lock within, he was at ease spying on the lives and deeds of each. And at the end of the tenth year, he had seen many things, and had heard a great deal more.</p>\n<p>One dark Octolliard night thick with shadows, he crept into the lair of the water dragon, Aguabrial. His master, Rushu, had instructed him on which paths to follow in order to reach the dragon's hideout. For as well as he knew the world, he had yet to discover a single one of the famous Dofus his master had told him about.</p>\n<p>On this particular night, the autumn rains were even heavier than usual. Djaul had dashed halfway across the country to get to Aguabrial's grotto, sploshing through the cascading downpour. He entered the dragon's lair and waited for many hours, immobile in the shadows, hiding among stalagmites and blue-hued toads. The demon greedily eyed the hillock of gold in the middle of the lair while surveying the comings and goings of the dragon. After much time, he formulated a scheme: he would start by bewitching the rains falling around the grotto.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>A very voluptuous water nymph emerged from the waters; the demon had made her incredibly beautiful. In the blink of an eye (and a few bats of the eyelashes), she had seduced the blue dragon. But would the dragon offer her a sacred egg as a token of his affection, as Djaul hoped?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some weeks later, the demon's patience seemed about to be rewarded. A turquoise allure emanated from an oblong form poised at the peak of Aguabrial's hill of treasure. Could it be a Dofus? Djaul was much too far to say with certainty. Making full use of the shadows, the demon crawled slowly closer, and closer still, until... it WAS a Dofus! A turquoise Dofus! It certainly wasn't a black or a white Dofus, but Djaul was elated all the same. Rushu would be satisfied...</p>\n<p>For an entire month, Djaul watched, through his proxy the water sprite, as the magic of the egg grew. She asked the dragon to ensure that the egg was constantly warmed by his magic breath, and the egg's powers continued to grow stronger and stronger. As for Aguabrial, he only saw stars.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Djaul's deception would have been perfect if only Ereziah Melkewel, an alchemist and friend of the dragon (as well as an excellent exorcist), hadn't poked his nose in...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Ereziah had come to ask the dragon's advice about an aqueous unbewitchment that was proving more difficult than expected. At the sight of the water sprite, he immediately suspected some demonic trickery. The sprite was a classic beauty: her brown tresses framed a finely-featured face with skin as pale as moonlight. Her blue eyes, her mischievous nose, her pearly lips... a linen tunic which clung tightly to the skin outlining her generous curves. What's more, she was a great cook... By Osamodas' three dragons, it was all much too good to be true! But Ereziah wasn't easy to disturb. He pretended to fall under the magic creature's charms, and promised to offer her jewellery that \"only your beauty can equal in splendour\". He also swore to his friend to return to see the precious Dofus and bestow on it a magical power.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Why not?\" Djaul thought. \"The combination of dragon magic and alchemical magic couldn't hurt it. Quite the opposite! This Dofus would be one of the most powerful ever.\"</p>\n<p>Ereziah came back the following day with a mysterious package. Under the curious eyes of Aguabrial, the water sprite, and Djaul, he unwrapped a strange sculpture: four heads with very large jaws attached to each other. He called them \"Trip Trap Shackles\", and explained that they were a very ancient magical mechanism, worthy of Xelor himself, created through the combined efforts of a goldsmith and a jeweller. The water sprite, having become a bit cheeky after a month of existence, got impatient and demanded to know where her magic present was.</p>\n<p>\"To be worthy of this present, you must make yourself more beautiful than you've ever been!\" Ereziah told her.</p>\n<p>Eager to obey, the sprite, with a crystal laugh, draped herself in blueish steam.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"You shall have your reward, beautiful sprite,\" Ereziah said silkily. \"Place your hands in the magic jaws, and they'll wrap your wrists with the most beautiful bracelets that have ever existed.\" The innocent girl obeyed. The jaws closed upon her delicate wrists and adorned them with... manacles and chains!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The thing about these magic bracelets,\" explained Ereziah, \"is that they prevent you from drawing the energy you need to live. Tell me, dear heart, what is it, or rather, who is it, that you need to live?\" Fallen to her knees, the sprite opened her mouth to answer, but couldn't find the strength. Aguabrial had started to object when Djaul, seeing his ruse was discovered, came out of the shadows. He rushed to the centre of the lair, but Ereziah blocked his way. In one quick motion, he unsheathed his scimitar and attacked. He'd have opened the exorcist's throat had Aguabrial not intervened. Djaul's blade instead gashed Ereziah's thigh. The dragon reared up to his full, frightening height before Djaul. The demon, seeing that all was lost, abandoned the Dofus and fled.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Djaul's enchantment was broken and Ereziah was hurt. Aguabrial, furious at having been deceived by a demon, shed a tear of rage, which fell upon Djaul's creature. The beautiful water sprite was revealed to in fact be a succubus in agony... Aguabrial finished the pitiful creature off by carrying her into a violent stream of water. Then he prepared to destroy the Dofus – in his eyes, a reminder of his folly. While Ereziah pleaded with him not to destroy it, the Dofus hatched. The shell flew away in pieces, and a jet of cerulean vapour appeared. Bolgrot was born, a birth brought on by Djaul's tricks and greediness.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the actual Turquoise Dofus, which was part of the six primordial Dofus, was buried beneath the dragon's mountain of gold. The egg trembled. Its pulse became irregular. Nevermore would the Dofus beat in rhythm, and harmony no longer reigned over the world.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\n.document_content2_es-class6 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"107":{"id":107,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Tears of a Goddess","authorId":"<b>Acidrik Gutsplitter</b>","subTitleId":"Found Fragments: Part VII","contentId":"<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>According to the scholar Hel Munster, a simple flap of a moskito's wings can bring about a tempest on the other side of the world.

This is the story of how a new goddess entered the pantheon.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Djaul was running like the wind, through flooded fields and muddy forests. It turns out that trying to fool a blue dragon is rather dangerous. He had failed, and the results had been disastrous: the whole area was flooded under pouring rain. All this water had soon grown into torrents, rivers warning Aguabrial of his every move. How long had it been since he tried to fool the dragon? Impossible to tell... Isolated in the Aguabrial's den, Djaul had lost track of time. And the rain pouring down since Octolliard was flooding the landscape and erasing the course of the seasons. It was then that it occurred to Djaul to use his privilege as a protector and consult the Divine Clock.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It appeared at his request, each of its twelve purple gems glowing brightly. The demon turned to face it. As he squinted to read the date, he felt anger bubbling up inside. He could see now why the Novamaire rains seemed to have been going on so long...! Brumaire had cut into Descendre by sixteen days! Straight away, Djaul unleashed Descendre's icy chill upon the world. At least it would calm the waters for a time... For two weeks, the demon stayed in the darkness of the southern forests, ruminating on his failure until the end of Descendre, burying the land in snow and ice. By the last day of Descendre, he was ready to take his revenge.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That day, just like every year, Solar made for the heights of Amakna. He was about to proclaim the start of Javian and the beginning of a new year. Djaul was waiting for him, hidden in the shadows. On the eleventh stroke of midnight, the demon leapt forth and let his rage and fury explode. Solar was caught off guard by the attack but he fought like a warrior. The fight between the two protectors was so violent that traces can still be seen in the stones and rocks all around.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Solar collapsed, beaten to death. Victorious, Djaul hurled the corpse of the protector of Javian down the mountains of Amakna. This Descendre was to be one of the longest and harshest that the inhabitants of the World of Ten had ever known.</p>\n<p>Famines, epidemics and pillaging devastated the land, And the inhabitants struggled to cope with the situation. Only the goddesses seemed to be paying attention to their disciples. Fecas and Cras could use white fire to stave off the cold. Eniripsas could count on their healing arts to keep themselves alive. As for the others, they were growing weaker and weaker every day. Adventurers who once stood tall and proud, glorious warriors, were now found on the roadside, dead from cold and exhaustion and covered up with ice.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One day, at last, a prophet came. He said he used to be a lumberjack, and that he was now spreading the good word of the goddess Sacrier. A new goddess? \"Yes!\", the prophet replied. \"The needy are swearing their loyalty to her, giving her their suffering. And the goddess is helping them recover their strength and vigour...\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>All over the world, people prayed for the torment to stop. But their prayers were no longer addressed to seemingly uncaring gods. Now they were for the goddess Sacrier, who seemed to be a goddess of compassion. Before, she had only had a hundred or so disciples, but now followers were flooding in. The strength that the goddess had given to her believers made up for the pain caused by the cold.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The faithful Sacriers walked from the Cania Plains to Amakna Harbour to convert those who were lost and in need. Later on, the prophet pronounced the following verses:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"We were five hundred, but with swift support</p>\n<p>Grew to three thousand as we reached the port,</p>\n<p>So that seeing us marching to that stage,</p>\n<p>Those most terrified found new courage!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"465\" height=\"400\" src=\"##png,113##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>(These lines became so famous they travelled far and wide and were adopted by a certain scribbler, much later and in another world... but that is another story!) Djaul, meanwhile, had followed the advent of the goddess with great interest. He was wondering how he could take advantage of the situation. Perched high up in the branches of a beech tree, he was observing the Sacriers' movements one day when he felt a hand grab him and pull him back violently.</p>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"308\" height=\"338\" src=\"##png,114##\"></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Taken by surprise, Djaul tumbled downward, unable to catch hold of a branch. Dazed and winded by his fall, he saw Silvosse, protector of Flovor, standing in front of him, with his fists clenched on the handle of a huge hammer.</p>\n<p>\"Demon, my trees are freezing! And all because of you!! And you, Djaul the Flounderer, you think you can come and put your claws in the bark of my cherished trees? That's not how it works, I'm afraid! You see this one?” He pointed to the tree. \"Well, it can no longer stand your presence in its branches... and neither can I!\"</p>\n<p>Djaul dodged Silvosse's mighty blow by the skin of his teeth. As the steel head of the hammer slammed into the ground, the snow all around it melted instantly.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><img hspace=\"0\"  align=\"center\" width=\"435\" height=\"670\" src=\"##png,115##\"></p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"108":{"id":108,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Tears of a Goddess (2)","authorId":"<b>Acidrik Gutsplitter</b>","subTitleId":"Found Fragments: Part VIII","contentId":"<p>\"Give way, Djaul!

Djaul stood up and headed south, still staggering.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>At that moment, the gods were assembled to welcome the goddess Sacrier. \"What did she do to deserve her place!?\" Rushu shouted angrily. \"You know perfectly well, Rushu. She simply has dedicated disciples who have faith in her,\" the god Iop answered quietly, before adding, \"And they are growing in number every day.\"</p>\n<br><p>\"I demand evidence! She's not worthy! I know it!\" Rushu screamed, pointing at the goddess, who remained impassive.</p>\n<br><p>\"No need for evidence,\" the god Iop replied, and before he could say another word, the goddess Sacrier took the Divine Clock in her hands.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>She was holding it as if it were an oracle. Each second that passed was whispering the life of the world... She and the other gods heard the suffering and the terror of the inhabitants of Amakna. They were prey to the most terrible fears, and within the chorus of rising and falling moans and whimpers, the gods could sense something soft and serious, something close to solace. Full of sympathy, a tear rolled down the goddess's cheek and fell onto the Divine Clock. It seeped into the mechanism and slid over the time frog who croaked in surprise... The Clock seemed to come to life. It gave a sudden jolt, and space and time, past and present seemed to crumple...</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>At that very moment, Xelor predicted that Bonta and Brakmar, the rivals, would be destroyed during the war of the cities and that, thanks to the goddess's tear, they would be reborn from the chaos that History had thrown them into.

For the Eleven are not unique. They are not the only ones – far from it! Truth be told, they are swarming all around us, often completely ignored by mere mortals.</p>\n<p>In one of his famous booklets, the <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Diis Ignotis</span>, Hel Munster estimated their number at one thousand eight hundred and twenty-four. The famous theorist of the Quadramental Breeze maintains that the plethora of gods drift across the universe on this magical zephyr to the World of Ten. Naturally, just like all the other philosophers that specialise in deities, he has never been able to prove it.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>His list of gods and goddesses includes loads of zany characters: the god of edible mushrooms, the god of putting Moskitos to sleep on summer nights, and the god of exciting dances for marsh worms (exciting for fish, that is), as well as gods who seem essential, such as the one who goes against all odds to magnify the strength of a hit or the effect of a spell tenfold, the one who can make trees grow faster, and the one who uses monsters' remains to make useful implements, beautiful trinkets and items which will make the lives of adventurers everywhere that little bit easier.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>In short, we live alongside a multitude of gods, always on the watch, ready to fly into the arms of the first living being to give them the slightest hint of attention (it's all they need at first). The goal behind such an unnecessary show of affection, of course, is to change the aforementioned hint of attention into genuine FAITH. Indeed, a god's debut is quite modest. As badly as they want to find fame as awesome, all-powerful divinities, when it comes to making mortals spare them a prayer, the only means they really have at their disposal are intuitions, signs and disembodied voices. And lots of mortals don't even believe in those things! Clearly, becoming a famous god is hard work.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Take the goddess Sacrier for instance. She wasn't born yesterday... She managed to work her way into the tight circle of really useful gods...</p>\n<p>When she first started her rise to power, one thing was crystal clear: the World of Ten was a world of suffering. A whole range of suffering, at that: pain, devastation, torment, torture and so on (in fact, it's really weird that none of the others gods had noticed). When gods are looking for believers, the idea is simple: to make a name for yourself, you've got to find a gap in the market. And the goddess Sacrier understood that better than anyone!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>She chose an apprentice lumberjack. With an axe in his hands, he was like lightning: he never hit the same spot twice. He was so clumsy that he had sliced the tops off three of his fingers in his first week. Every day, the goddess would come next to him, teeny-tiny and invisible. She waited patiently for him to reach the end of his tether and scream with pain or anger. This moment finally came. While he was holding his head with his bleeding hands and hitting it against a trunk, she whispered in his ear:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>If before you struck the wood</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>You hit yourself as hard as you could,</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Through your veins would course</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>adrenaline – a hefty dose!</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Just imagine what good,</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Such a dose would do!</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>You'd climb the greatest hills with ease,</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>With iron lungs and sturdy knees</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>And split those mighty, towering trees. Clean in two!</span></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The apprentice lumberjack followed the voice's advice. His axe fell. His fingers were suddenly healed, and the log split in half from top to bottom. He then heard the voice inside his head:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Call yourself a victim no longer,</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>What doesn't kill you makes you stronger,</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>It's the only way to inspire!</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>Sacred are your cries, Sacrier!</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the voice he heard was a female voice, the Lumberjack started to believe in a goddess called Sacrier. Every day, he rained down blows on his fingers, head and arms, and his strength increased beyond all belief. He started to chant prayers of his own creation: \"Joy of receiving, pleasure of giving,\" or \"Offer one's right cheek, hit with a straight left.\" At this point, the goddess Sacrier knew he was ready to become a prophet...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>All through the terrible winter brought about by Solar's death, the lumberjack went to preach in the countryside. The peasants had suffered so much that they listened eagerly to the stranger, who promised to replace their suffering with a new strength.</p>\n<p>His prayers spread faster than whooping cough. Very soon, his believers were legion. The goddess was added to the Pantheon.

Wishes suddenly granted? Pure coincidence? Any philosopher will tell you there's no such thing as coincidence. A prophet never thanks emptiness. And god grows.

With time, he becomes powerful...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>The World, the Gods</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>The books of the ancestors are probably right: as soon as this World was created, the ten gods each blessed it with a kind deed. I don't see why it should be any different anyway. Trust an old erudite man, the gods were better off doing it. Even if the gods usually get along reasonably well, they don't hesitate to fight over attracting new souls that will be faithful and devoted to them! By the way, a World recently created is a very attractive place for a soul. Quite often, very old souls decide to incarnate themselves there, keeping full conscience of their past lives. That's why our World, in spite of its young age, counts skilled and expert warriors, as well as alchemists, smithmagi who have perfectly mastered their art, and exceptional beings that the old legends still talk about.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Cults and Faiths</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>At the World's beginning, cults were a lot more numerous than today. Devotion to one unique god even circulated among some magi and priests.</p>\n<br> <p>I shall allow myself to digress a little here, as I'd like to talk about the physiognomy of the beings of our World. Oh! If you've read this far then it's probably because you're wondering why Cras have pointy ears, why Osamodas have forked tails, and why Sadidas have bushy heads. Why are Innkeepers so fat and why don't they have the features of a Sram or a Xelor? Well, regarding the overweight innkeeper, an excess of beer probably has something to do with it. But another thousand questions are yet to be asked.</p>\n<br><p>One thing is certain: down here (and the rules are the same throughout the entire Universe), faith conditions physical appearance. Indeed, the faith given by a soul to a divinity has an influence on its mortal coil. The former tends to take up the features (both physical and behavioural) of the venerated divinity.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>What about blood ties, you may wonder? Easy. If followers from different cults got married, they wouldn't have children in the biological sense. Their children would be akin to spiritual sons and daughters. A soul that felt an affinity with the values of its \"parents\" could decide to become their son or daughter. You must understand that an incarnated soul can choose to be a disciple of a god OR wait a while and reflect on its real faith. In this second case, it would incarnate with a humanoid appearance and a child would be born! It would now be free to become a disciple or to remain an atheist. In the latter case, it would keep its humanoid appearance. A soul that decided to incarnate within a long lineage of Iops would embrace the Iop faith and would most certainly look like a young Iop.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Whereas a soul that decided to incarnate itself within a long lineage of innkeepers would have all its teenage years to decide to which cult it wanted to devote its terrestrial life to. This decision-making period ends at puberty. Once the stream of spiritual hormones has gone, you can no longer embrace a cult – save a miraculous conversion recognised by the god himself.</p>\n<br><p>Many a time I have heard this question: Herdegrize, where are we born? I always answer that it depends on the choice of the soul... It may decide to incarnate itself in an egg that will then hatch, be it in a Prespic's nest, or as an Evil Rose, how could I possibly know? What really matters is that beings come to life!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Praying to Your God</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Followers who want to pay homage to their god would be well advised to go to the city of Astrub. There, they can leave their offerings at their god's feet. They can do the same in one of the temples of Amakna. No need for luxurious gifts! To please your god, just think about the gift they gave to the world a long time ago. You shall then offer your god something that exists as a result of this gift.

Among them was Rushu... a force to be reckoned with.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The ten gods had followed the evolution of the world with great interest. Chubby clouds were swaying in the sky. The two celestial light sources were alternating in their slow shifts, one for the day, the other for the night. The world was covered with mountains, forests, plains, rivers, and seas. Here and there, smoking geysers burst the earth open, sending water springing up from jagged openings. Life blossomed in all four corners of the world. Grass laughed under the hot, humid wind of the plains. The first shoots grew in a thousand ways. The faithful peoples built civilisations. The dragon eggs were beating in unison, and their aura was spreading harmony.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The three dragons of Osamodas made it possible to influence this world with magic, be it white or black. A multitude of small gods grew incessantly: gods without believers, prepubescent gods, uneducated gods... One chose to live on the leaves of an Ash Tree; another lay down with its feet dipped into a droplet of dew... Little by little, they filled the world with their tiny, enchanting presence.</p>\n<p>Legions of demons were eyeing the world as well... Though nobody knows for sure, it is said that they were created by Osamodas, a god who could almost be mistaken for a demon himself! Mighty major demons and scrawny minor demons alike scurried around this planet full of life. Naturally, they could not cross the threshold. All the demons knew that. A pact had been sealed between the worldly gods and the otherworldly demons; a pact forbidding demons to invade the World of Ten...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Do not feel sorry for them, dear reader! Anyone who knows demons knows there are very good reasons for locking them up in an infernal plane made of sulphur and stone, where the roads are probably paved with good intentions, but are also hot, burning hot, suffocatingly unbearably hot.</p>\n<p>So they gathered in front of this invisible border. The smallest demons were the noisiest: the dung demon, the mouldy demon, the demons of yellow pus, green pus, of carcasses and maggots, even the lowly demon of warts and boils;  the whole evil rabble was assembled there, as curious and restless as rats on holiday.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Presently, cries and protests rose from the hubbub. Rushu, the most powerful demon in the Krosmoz, had arrived. He split the crowd open with his whip. Pieces of horn, tufts of burning hair, shattered teeth and even the odd lump of eye or ear flew through the air.  He elbowed his way to the front and peered down to see what was happening in the World of Ten. Then he shouted out to the gods:</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Brothers! What is happening on this world for you to give it your greatest attention?\"</p>\n<p>\"You have not been invited to join us, Rushu!\" roared the god Iop. We already have five gods of black magic and five gods of white magic. It guarantees balance, that rare thing!\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rushu narrowed his eyes. He ran his molten tongue over his sharp teeth, which in a mouth other than Rushu's would surely have monstrous and terrifying consequences. A piercing whistle sounded from nowhere.</p>\n<p>\"Very well, lord Iop... I shall respect the pact,\" mocked Rushu, \"and when I say I, I mean I and all my demons.\" As he spoke, Rushu tapped on the head of a little scarlet demon, whose skin sizzled a little at each touch. Almost imperceptibly, the goddess Feca drew her shield a little closer.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"And what about the Dofus? Are there sacred eggs in this new world?\" asked Rushu in a deceitfully naive tone.</p>\n<p>\"Possibly,\" replied the goddess Cra. She felt her bow vibrating in her hand, as though it were urging her to tread carefully. Innocently, the demon added: \"After all, there are dragons in this world, are there not?\"</p>\n<p>\"There are indeed dragons,\" conceded the goddess.</p>\n<p>\"We shall know whether there are Dofus here when, if ever, they start beating. And to do so, to pick up and count their heartbeats, we need a clock - a divine clock!\" reasoned Iop.</p>\n<p>\"And who better to make one than our friend Xelor here?\" winked Ecaflip the feline god.

But beware! They're not as stupid as Iops! They are sociable creatures and when they live in groups, they help and protect each other. They are even capable of thinking before they act, which makes them more intelligent than most modern-day adventurers.</p>\n<br> <p>During my peregrinations, I have only ever come across three species of wild Dragoturkey: the Ginger Dragoturkey, the Almond Dragoturkey, and the rarest and most dangerous of all, the Golden Dragoturkey.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Here is an interesting fact about wild Dragoturkeys: they can live together no matter their colour, but when it comes to mating, they categorically refuse to mate with Dragoturkeys of another colour when in the wild.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Capturing</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Capturing Dragoturkeys tends to be a delicate mission since they are naturally aggressive.</p>\n<br> <p>Most of the time, you have to go through a hunting phase to weaken them before you can hope to capture them.</p>\n<br> <p>However, wild Dragoturkeys have evolved over the generations to became extremely quick and agile... so much so that it's almost impossible to capture them.</p>\n<br><p>Nowadays, you must be equipped with a good net if you want any chance of catching a wild Dragoturkey. It is equally important to hypnotise it or distract its attention for a while in order to catch and tame it.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The only way to mesmerise a wild Dragoturkey and calm it down for a moment, giving you a chance to capture it, is to cast a special spell at the right moment.</p>\n<br> <p>Only a few breeders know this spell and they usually only teach it to their most faithful and deserving disciples.</p>\n<br> <p>However, there is an old hunter lost in the mountains who will pass on his knowledge and teach the spell to worthy adventurers. It's thanks to him that I managed to capture my first Dragoturkeys.</p>\n<br> <p>Once you've learned this spell, you must cast it on the Dragoturkey you want to capture and quickly weaken it with a few well-placed attacks. Then just swish your net and hope for the best! Easy peasy, right?</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Breeding</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Once you've captured your wild Dragoturkey, you can breed it by having it mate with another Dragoturkey.</p>\n<br> <p>Before all that, you need to find a paddock.</p>\n<br> <p>Even poor adventurers can breed Dragoturkeys thanks to the public paddocks in cities and villages that specialise in breeding. Careful though, as despite their affordability, public paddocks are renowned for their insalubrity and overpopulation, which often lead to problems or slow down the rate at which the mounts there progress.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Wealthy breeders generally prefer to invest in building their own paddocks. That way they are in charge of which Dragoturkeys are allowed to come into contact with their own, and they can organise the paddock to suit their own specific needs and purposes.</p>\n<br> <p>Breeders with their own paddocks like to install various appliances which automatically carry out the arduous and repetitive tasks required for Dragoturkey breeding.</p>\n<br> <p>These machines allow breeders to develop their Dragoturkeys' aggressiveness, maturity, energy and serenity even when they (the breeders) are not there.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>These items are usually made by experienced handymen, who can knock together surprising machines out of a variety of resources.</p>\n<br> <p>Wealthy breeders buy the machines made of the rarest resources, as they are usually much more solid and efficient than those built with cheap resources or salvaged materials.</p>\n<br> <p>You must take good care of your Dragoturkey if you want it to grow quickly. Careful breeders take some time off to go and visit their Dragoturkeys and interact with them to make them happy. Dragoturkeys are very attached to their masters and if they aren't given enough attention and affection they will become stunted and ill.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>A Dragoturkey must be healthy to grow, and to be healthy, the delicate balance between its aggressiveness, serenity, stamina and love must be maintained.</p>\n<br> <p>Bear in mind that Dragoturkeys are vicious animals when out in the wild, and even when tamed they retain strong primal instincts. If you want them to be healthy, don't try to domesticate them completely.</p>\n<br> <p>That's why a good breeder will pay close attention to his Dragoturkey's statistics, balancing its stamina and aggressiveness while keeping it serene and in love, so it stays sociable.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Dragoturkeys whose aggressiveness is in balance with their serenity are healthy and can grow properly.</p>\n<br> <p>Some famous Dragoturkey breeders declare that an overly aggressive mount can't fall in love but can improve its stamina.</p>\n<br> <p>Similarly, it is said that a mount that is too serene can't increase its stamina, but can fall in love.</p>\n<br> <p>The healthiest mounts are therefore those whose aggressiveness and serenity are balanced. These mounts usually grow quickly, remain in love, have plenty of stamina and mate easily, which is important for breeders who want to succeed.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Reproduction</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Any breeder worth their salt will try to mate their Dragoturkey in order to earn money or to improve their Dragoturkeys through selective crossbreeding.</p>\n<br> <p>Dragoturkeys can only mate when they are fully mature and when they have become fertile, which happens when they have experienced life.</p>\n<br> <p>Dragoturkeys can be considered mature when their owners are able to mount them, though this does not mean that they are fertile.</p>\n<br> <p>For that to happen, their owners must spend lots of time with them to help them develop. Good breeders will \"just know\" when their mounts are fertile, but such subtleties are beyond the reach of this book.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Should you desire further information on Dragoturkey fertility, a flick through the pages of the following reference book will tell you all you need to know: <i>Fertile Dragoturkey: My Daily Fight</i>. However, the book seems to be the victim of its own success and is sold out.</p>\n<br> <p>A word of warning: although the wild Dragoturkeys you capture are generally all mature and fertile (which comes in quite handy), you must remember that they are wild animals which can't stand to be kept in captivity for too long.</p>\n<br> <p>That's why wild Dragoturkeys tend to escape once they've mated in captivity for the first time.</p>\n<br> <p>Put yourself in their shoes: mating in captivity can't hold a candle to mating in the great outdoors, where they can be in harmony with nature, surrounded by orchids, streams and singing Piwis.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Before mating, all Dragoturkeys must be in love. It's important to stimulate your Dragoturkey plenty, so it's loved up enough to mate.</p>\n<br> <p>Mating is generally an intense and emotional part of a Dragoturkey's life. They are passionate creatures and mating is one of the only means they have of expressing their unbounded love.</p>\n<br> <p>For the mating to be successful, both Dragoturkeys must have a lot of stamina, or else the encounter runs the risk of falling flat on its face. A good reproductive Dragoturkey is a Dragoturkey with stamina.</p>\n<br> <p>Once mating is over, the Dragoturkey couple is very tired, if not completely exhausted. Before they can mate again, they will need to get plenty of rest to recover their strength.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Only old, experimented breeders know the exact length of the gestation period.</p>\n<br> <p>The period can be quite hard to predict, but it seems to depend on the type of Dragoturkey that has been impregnated.</p>\n<br> <p>Some breeders say that Dragoturkeys are able to lay more than one egg after a single mating session, but this claim remains to be proved.</p>\n<br> <p>As a general rule, as soon as the egg is laid, a young Dragoturkey hatches from it.</p>\n<br> <p>Please note that pregnant Dragoturkeys will refuse to give birth in a paddock. They must be placed in a stable so they feel safe and calm.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Crossbreeding</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>One of the most exciting elements of breeding is discovering new types of Dragoturkey through selective pairing.</p>\n<br> <p>Dragoturkeys undergo mutations regularly. You will find new types of Dragoturkey in almost every new generation.</p>\n<br> <p>Careful breeders take great care when choosing the Dragoturkeys that will mate with theirs. They act like parents who are about to marry off their children.</p>\n<br> <p>Dragoturkeys differ from each other by their appearance, character and efficiency.</p>\n<br> <p>That's why breeders keep on crossbreeding different types of Dragoturkeys. If they're lucky, they'll eventually get extremely rare Dragoturkeys with the most unexpected assets.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>A Dragoturkey will inherit the physical features of its blood parents and ancestors.</p>\n<br> <p>That means you have to go back several generations in the family tree to determine which physical features will be inherited.</p>\n<br> <p>Only by studying the family tree and trying various crossbreeds will a breeder be able to determine (more or less precisely) the type of Dragoturkey that will result from a particular pairing.</p>\n<br> <p>One thing is certain in this murky matter of genetics: the blood parents of a Dragoturkey are more likely to pass on their own physical features than more distant ancestors.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Feeding</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Dragoturkeys are neither greedy nor difficult to feed, but you should still make sure you know what is good for them.</p>\n<br> <p>A Dragoturkey that is used for running around, fighting or carrying heavy loads will lose its energy little by little, until eventually it is too tired to be of any use at all.</p>\n<br> <p>When this happens, you will need to take it to a public paddock, where it will be fed and given time to rest. You can also feed it yourself if you have the means.</p>\n<br> <p>Dragoturkeys eat everything: they like meat and fish, but will be happy with seeds and plants too. Some are pickier than others, of course, so learn what yours likes!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Riding Mounts</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>A Dragoturkey can be ridden only when it is fully grown and mature.</p>\n<br> <p>Each time you try to mount it, your Dragoturkey will get a little more tired.</p>\n<br> <p>Dragoturkeys are creatures with a lot of stamina but they'll still get tired if you don't let them get enough rest.</p>\n<br> <p>You can feed your Dragoturkeys to help replenish their energy, although the best course of action is to let them have a proper rest, either in a public stable or in a private paddock.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Over time, Dragoturkeys build up more and more stamina, which enables them to move faster and travel longer distances. Be careful, though: an exhausted Dragoturkey won't let you ride it and will move at a snail's pace.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Fighting</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Once tamed, Dragoturkeys are reckless, loyal creatures.</p>\n<br> <p>They won't fight with their masters, but they'll do everything they can to protect them, them him escape or bring them closer to the enemy to attack.</p>\n<br> <p>The more time a Dragoturkey spends helping its master fight, the more efficient it will become.</p>","contentCSS":"null"},"119":{"id":119,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Hyrkul's Advent","authorId":"<b>Domen the Dark</b>","subTitleId":"Immoral and Unusual Annals","contentId":"<p>You who are preparing to read this story, beware!

Amaknian farmers and shepherds only had to be wary of Boowolves or maybe Prespics – natural predators, who would steal a Gobball or two, and occasionally ravage their fields...</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>The local Feca shepherds, weary of the beasts' misdeeds, formed small armed parties. Lukryh Leuk was one of these Fecas. There was no match for the young and intrepid Lukryh when it came to hunting Miliboowolves. \"A Miliboowolf for a Tofu, and a Boowolf for a Gobball!\" was his motto. But the peaceful lands of the world were soon invaded by creatures even more terrifying than Boowolves. Indeed, many a peasant's foot was held to the fire in these days – some tried to reverse their position around the fire, laying headfirst, but frankly, this caused even more pain, and the smell of burnt hair.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Never before in Amakna had there been such terrifying creatures, and the peasants thoroughly soiled their briefs. Djaul, Rushu's servant and guardian of the month of Descendre, was one of these creatures. He prowled about the World, and some nights skulked through Amakna Village. From his appearance, it was obvious he wasn't on his way to help the needy: horns thrusting from his skull, sanguine eyes, cloven hooves, and a breath that would give a Bwork fits.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Numerous erections – temples I mean: tall, thin, and rigid – were soon produced and chants of pious desperation echoed throughout the nights. All the gods' faithful wanted to counterbalance Djaul's growing power. The World had to be under the guidance of the gods, no matter what Djaul and Rushu might try! But the spiritual power of the temples was insufficient...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The fear-filled hours slipping thusly by were wretched, and Xelor knew it! The god designated Menalt the centaur as the leader of a new knightly order. The order was put under the protection of one of Osamodas' dragons, Helioboros the White. The dragon christened them the \"Order of the Valiant Heart\" and blessed Menalt with the ability to wield white thunder. The knights were in charge of surveilling temples, roads and trails.</p>\n<br> <p>The Order counted among its number dozens of young knights, all proud and loyal. Not just anyone could become a knight of the order – Commander Menalt decreed that only an act of bravery would merit induction into the order.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>In the meantime, Lukryh Leuk, the young Feca shepherd, had become a famous hunter, celebrated throughout Amakna for his abilities. He was known to hunt the most powerful monsters there were. He'd decided to go and join the order, and no one doubted he'd be able to get in. His attempt would have serious consequences, however. Lukryh, as a testament to his bravery, had promised to bring Menalt a truly exceptional trophy. He plunged deep into the forests, and was never seen again.*</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>* Everyone thought the young man – who would have made a truly remarkable knight – had fallen victim to one of Djaul's creatures, but no one could actually prove it. The search went on for months. The knights penetrated far into the lands to the south. And it was during one of their expeditions that the knights found the city of Brakmar, and they knew right away that this city reeked of demonic influence.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>To counter Brakmar, Jiva, Pouchecot and Menalt pushed the loyal disciples to build Bonta, which would serve as a fortified defence against the demons. The Order of the Valiant Heart, now the militant factor of Bonta, protected the city from Brakmarian harassment with zeal and vigour. Right up until that autumn day known as the Crimson Dawn...</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>And now, you, having read this far, know enough about Lukryh Leuk.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>What follows is a vision that appeared to me after I finished writing this book... There can be no doubt but that I wrote it under the influence of a spirit – perhaps it was even the soul of Hyrkul who wrote these lines, and not me...

The Feca shepherds were worried. Each morning, they found dozens of beasts, sometimes entire herds, passive, their eyes void of any emotion. However, the nights were quiet, and without even the slightest sign of agitation. The knights of the Order, heavily armed and ever-vigilant, stepped up their patrols.</i></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p><i>That morning, I made my round of the pens, as usual. When I got near my flock, I saw my Gobballs all facing the same way, heads toward the forest. Stiff and motionless. I felt rage bubbling up inside me. A fresh trail led to the forest. It was the first time \"the thing\" had left tracks. I smiled: its mistake would cost \"the thing\" dearly.</i></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><i>I followed the trail for some time before reaching the edge of the Treechnid Forest. I took the main path. The grass was withered and the deeper I went, the more the air was filled with the heady scent of humus. Bushes snagged my clothes often, as if trying to keep me from advancing. At a bend in the path, I saw a clearing in the trees. I left the path to go and take a closer look. With each step, it seemed to me that the clearing moved further and further away from me.</i></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><i>I was exhausted. I was getting bogged down in mud. Vermin were swarming around, and worms were coiling around my ankles when suddenly, night fell.

I was completely worn out. I saw a tattered silhouette rising before me. It was a ghost, a winged soul that looked like a black dragon. Panting, it continued: \"I'm going... to make you more powerful... than you can possibly imagine... You shall be... a warlord! But in exchange... I'll be with you... day... and... night...\" The words swirled in my head, and I fainted.</i></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p><i>Lukryh was dead.</i></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p><i>Hyrkul lived.</i></p>","contentCSS":"null"},"120":{"id":120,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Mini Wa","authorId":"<b>Oshimo Bigglip</b>","subTitleId":"How to raise your favourite pet","contentId":"<p>Preface: p. 3</p>\n<p>Introduction: p. 5</p>\n<p>Feeding Your Pet: p. 6</p>\n<p>Treating Malnutrition: p.8</p>\n<p>Treating Injuries: p. 9</p>\n<p>Your Mini Wa's Diet: p. 10</p>\n<p>Using Your Pet in Combat: p. 11</p>\n<p>About the Bow Kennel: p. 13</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Preface</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as happens every year, a new type of Black Plague ravaged Amakna.

The incident traumatised it so much that now, it's unable to eat any fish whatsoever.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Using Your Pet in Combat</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your pet will typically help you in combat by defending you or helping to make your attacks more effective.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Be sure to keep a close eye on your pet, though, because it will be injured every time you lose a fight against a creature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you don't heal it after each loss, it will eventually die, and you'll have to find a way to revive your pet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, the only way to heal a pet after losing a battle is to feed it Eniripsa Powder.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Customarily, when adventurers fight one another, pets are never targeted and therefore cannot be injured, even in the event of defeat.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to be sure your pet doesn't get injured, simply keep it in your inventory rather than having it by your side during combat.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>About the Bow Kennel</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bow Kennel is a place generally reserved for raising pets.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can leave your pet there so it's safe and well-fed while you are away. However, your pet will not improve while in the Bow Kennel, as it is away from its master.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You typically have to pay a fee to drop off your pet, and then another fee when you pick it up later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The amount you have to pay will depend on how long you're gone for. The longer your pet stays in the Bow Kennel, the steeper the fee.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The Bow Kennel is also where you can buy Eniripsa Powder to heal your pet.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most well-known Bow Kennel is usually marked on adventurers' maps. It can be found next to Sufokia Gate.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>In conclusion, we should point out a physical limit to your Willy Peninzias's constitution.</p>\n<p>Once the creature has grown as much as it physically can, it will be virtually unable to improve any more.</p>\n<p>But be advised: if you stop caring for your Willy Peninzias properly once it has reached this state, its health will suffer greatly. You therefore need to continue to feed it regularly.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck to you and your pet!</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class8 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_de-class8 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class8 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"124":{"id":124,"typeId":1,"titleId":"How to Make Friends and Keep Them","authorId":"<b>Acidrik Gutsplitter</b>","subTitleId":"On <i>Roleplaying</i> and Good Manners","contentId":"<p>First Things First: p. 3</p>\n<p>Speaking Clearly: p. 4</p>\n<p>About the Interface: p. 5</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Roleplay</span> (RP): p. 6</p>\n<p>What Would the Character Say?: p. 8</p>\n<p>Behaviours to Avoid: p. 14</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>First Things First</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Before you find yourself a real, authentic friend, you'll have to walk a great many kamameters through moors and underground passages full of wild creatures, talk to people who could stand to be a bit more sociable, and sometimes even fight for the best and worst, until life finishes you off!</p>\n<p>I'll say it straight away, it's essential to talk to players and make friends because creatures are easier to defeat when you're in a group (called a party), and you'll also gain experience faster.</p>\n<p>Also, it's helpful to have the enlightened opinions of a few experienced players when you're negotiating prices on goods you want to buy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>This book describes the notions you must know if you want to make friends and become a popular hero!</span></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>Speaking Clearly</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Being understood when you speak is important!

When you roleplay, you breathe life into your character, everything from a backstory to a personality or a particular style, etc. Roleplaying is a bit like acting in a theatre production whose script is written by all the actors, little bit by little bit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To clarify all that, while roleplaying you embody a character, but the character is not yourself. Like an actor, you interpret the role of a fictitious character in a world that's more or less different from the \"real world\".</p>\n<p>The character you play may not look like you, and may not have the same personality or attitudes, or the same strengths and faults, ambitions, and definitely won't have the same life as you.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It's up to you to determine all that, and do everything you can to let their personality shine through in ways that make your character interesting and unique. Your character can be radically different than you, or it can be more or less a copy of your \"real life\" self, adapted to the Universe in which your character lives.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>What Would the Character Say?</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your character has their own spirit and way of speaking. So, try to stick to their moods and personality when making them talk. It's suggested you try to make your words as colourful as possible, and use old-fashioned expressions to help give a \"medieval\" feel, as DOFUS is largely a medieval-fantasy game (but it's not obligatory – we're not asking you to speak like Shakespeare).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Here are a few simple examples</span> of ways you could say \"Hi!\" while roleplaying.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(To a man): Greetings my Lord XXX. *bowing*</p>\n<p>(To a woman): Good afternoon to you, my fair lady. *kissing her hand*</p>\n<p>(To a group): Greetings, knaves! *spits on the ground*</p>\n<p>(A Brakmarian coming across another): *in a cold tone* Bad evening to you, follower of Rushu.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>There are a nearly infinite number of ways to say \"Hello\", and of course, even for such simple things, your character's personality should enter into it. The second example is fairly typical of a <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>\"Hello\"</span> from a character who tends to have a kind and friendly nature (this would be defined by a <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>good alignment</span>). The last two <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Hellos</span> would be from meaner characters (with a <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>\"bad\" alignment</span>), and the others are more <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>neutral.</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Note that it's generally more fun, in the context of roleplaying, to receive an original <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Hello</span>, rather than a <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Hello</span> using only emotes; ideally you should try to link the gesture and the words.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Another example:</span> How to leave a conversation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(To a man): I regret to inform you, my Lord, that I must leave you now. *nods*</p>\n<p>(To a woman): My dear Damsel, I'm sad to say that I have to stop contemplating your lovely eyes, but duty calls. *kissing her hand*</p>\n<p>(To an enemy): *ironic laugh* I'll see you soon... in your grave! *leaves*</p>\n<p>(To a group of enemies): I've no more time to waste with you swine! *turns on heels and walks away*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Leaving a roleplaying conversation is generally pretty simple – no need to ramble or over-complicate things. However if you must disconnect, it's generally a good idea to try and have your character leave the scene first.</p>\n<p>It's more interesting for the others to read \"Excuse me, I've urgent business to attend to! *leaves the room*\" than \"Sry gotta go ttfn\".</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>You may have noticed in the preceding examples that players frequently use '>6</span>asterisks (*)</p> to symbolise actions their character is performing that they are unable to perform in game:<span class='document_content2_fr-class\n<p></p>\n<p>*smiles weakly*</p>\n<p>*bows excessively*</p>\n<p>*nods*</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In an environment where the common cues of body language, facial expression, and vocal tone are missing, describing actions can help to give meaning, or even a second meaning, to your words. Of course, if you've obtained emotes in game, feel free to use them to make your point! In addition to actions, stars can be used to mark off narration: *Knows that XXX is lying and inches his hand nearer to the hilt of his sword...*</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>While roleplaying, it may be unavoidably necessary to insert some non-roleplaying comments, i.e. if you need to speak player to player and not character to character. Generally, role-players indicate non-roleplaying elements by surrounding them with parentheses. \"Greetings plebes! *shakes fist* (does anyone know where the Moowolf is?)\".</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>A Few Tips</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It's strongly recommended to start your sentences with capital letters, as well as following other capitalisation and grammar rules. Even if you're not a literary artist, make an effort to spell correctly and avoid abbreviations and SMS-language.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>While roleplaying, try to avoid anachronisms, and in general watch out for things which have no place in the world of DOFUS. Your character doesn't have a television, a cell phone, or a PC, and the history of DOFUS (the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>background</span>) doesn't include Napoleon or Cleopatra, for example. If you're roleplaying and you want to talk about that sort of thing, put it in parentheses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also watch out for game inconsistencies. Bowing to a character who is, in fact, on the other side of a wall will probably make your character look like a fool (although, absolutely nothing is stopping you from playing the role of a fool if you so wish).</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>Behaviours to Avoid</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Insults and personal attacks, whether disguised by roleplay or not, are not tolerated. This applies to individual players, groups of players, individual GMs or Mods, and groups of GMs and Mods. If your roleplaying character is an insulting character, try to be sure that you only insult people who know your character and are ok with it (that is to say, your friends). Note as well that there are many different ways to offer roleplaying insults without resorting to vulgarity and rudeness.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you're the victim of this sort of thing, please take screenshots as proof and contact DOFUS Support.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>In the same series and by the same author:</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Beginner's Manual</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>How to Become the Perfect Recruit</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>How to Make Friends and Keep Them</span></p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class6 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"125":{"id":125,"typeId":1,"titleId":"The dragon era","authorId":"<b>Acidrik Gutsplitter</b>","subTitleId":"Found Fragments: Part III","contentId":"<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Osamodas's three dragons breathed magic into the World.

A group of mercenaries made good use of its advantageous geographical position by meeting to devise their plans, leave for expeditions or hide an outlaw from the eyes of justice. They were called <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>the Band of Brutas</span>. In time, the camp became a village, then a well-populated city... all this despite its still uninviting name of Astrub, an anagram of <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Brutas</span>!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The original population of Astrub was composed predominantly of mercenaries who, after a life full of plundering and guerrilla warfare, decided to settle down to a calmer life and start a family. They retrained as crafters and, naturally, got along well with the mercenaries passing through, who joined groups looking for adventure and kamas. These visitors regularly consulted the wanted notices distributed by the local authorities – a custom that is still in vogue today. There's no better way to earn yourself a little pocket money!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>This geographical situation was perfect, not just for the mercenaries, but also for the Crackrocks. These creatures, which could and still can be seen roaming around the neighbourhood, soon started infecting the inhabitants' imaginations... even though they didn't infect much else.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The strangest rumours went round Astrub. For example, one particularly tenacious legend claimed that the Astrub Crackrocks delivered the newborn children in Astrub right to their parents' doorsteps.</p>\n<p>The reality, however, is quite different because, if the legend were true, they would soon have been serving Crackrock style gruel in the taverns of Astrub.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>In truth, nowhere else in the world will you find so many divine statues in one place, and for good reason! It is said the souls who come to incarnate in the world do so at the foot of the statue of their god. The giant stones offer themselves up to the sun and to the veneration of their followers in the sunny squares of Astrub, and watch as fresh incarnates emerge, sometimes speaking in a flowery language and behaving with unsightly mannerisms.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is, therefore, at the heart of the city of Astrub that young adventurers fight their first battles. It is also useful to go round and meet the inhabitants of Astrub: each disciple will find someone of his own class there to talk to who will also give him his first mission.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The marketplaces are diverse and prosperous, even if the resources on sale aren't always of the highest quality!!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What's more, the marketplaces and workshops create a very particular odour in the town, which is the result of the combined stenches emanating from abattoirs, food and smoke, accented with a hint of humus and decay. A persistent rumour claims that these sickening smells come from Astrub's caves and that anyone who is exposed to them will fall ill...</p>\n<p>It is also necessary to add that Astrub's Enutrofs travelled the town's underground galleries to exploit the gold mines. It's possible that the excavations upset some of the evil creatures or that they pierced a pocket of infectious gas, or an antediluvian septic tank... In any case, it's not safe to visit Astrub's underground tunnels and I strongly advise you not to take any tours down there, not even guided ones.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Tainela</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Also known by the name of the <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Cradle</span>, Tainela is the remains of a very ancient village, much older than Astrub. The Elders will tell you that souls used to incarnate at Tainela, not Astrub, but are they right? Can you really trust the senile imaginings that have come straight from the softened medullas of a wise man? Nobody will ever know for sure, since time, true to its nature, has destroyed all traces of this distant past.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Nowadays, Tainela is populated by Gobballs and Tofus who find relative safety in these places. Indeed, young disciples cut their teeth on these creatures, which, let's face it, aren't really very dangerous at all.</p>\n<p>Maybe you'll be lucky enough to meet one of the more experienced adventurers who come to pilfer skins and feathers, pick plants and make potions, unless they're looking for the legendary Royal Gobball. Feel free to ask them any questions. With a bit of luck one of them won't have his ears stuffed with Gobball Wool and will listen to you, and maybe even reply.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Amakna Village</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Amakna is such a well-known village that certain adventurers refer to the whole province, and even the world itself, by the same name. It's a forgivable error when you know that the destiny of the whole world is played out in Amakna!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Amakna is a peaceful village compared to the densely populated Astrub. All the same, the marketplace is very busy, and many disciples are regular visitors to the beautiful local temples.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The absence of markets just goes to show that Allister, the King of Amakna, has always favoured artisanal products. Many traders offer their services at the heart of the village. Furthermore, the quality of the equipment made here is much better than that at Astrub.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Both in memory of his own previous exploits and in the interests of educating young adventurers in the art of warfare, King Allister built the Kanojedo. This is where you can test your fighting abilities and try out your favourite techniques against an inanimate target.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To the east, you'll find Madrestam Harbour, where you can sing, dance, eat, drink and drink some more, even if nowadays people tend to prefer fishing on the quay or taking a boat to the famous Wabbit Island!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Amakna Castle</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Allister lives there as a recluse, alongside his court. The old King is very distrustful of the world outside, and it has been said that his confrontation with Esra'Ruoy'Dnim, Lord Rushu's demon liege, didn't leave him unscathed. It's also said that he has a dark secret that he prefers to keep locked away, deep inside himself...</p>\n<p>To distract himself from his dark moods, the King had the Royal Stud Farms built. They welcome mount breeders to Amakna, and bring a smile to many an adventurer's face.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Amakna Cemetery</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Situated on a small island to the south of Amakna Village, the Cemetery opens its rusty doors to adventurers, whether they be intrepid, reckless, crazy or all three.</p>\n<p>After having crossed a rickety bridge, you will find yourself right in the middle of the most unwelcoming monsters you will ever meet. Indeed, the cemetery's inhabitants really hate being disturbed, which is why they took the trouble to surround themselves with Kwoans, Evil Tofus and Chafers, who will make you think twice about coming back.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You might also come across some well-built young men down there, with an odd enough appearance to make even the bravest warriors turn a whiter shade of pale. Black hood on their heads, dark cape over their shoulders, they're known as <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Rogues</span>. If this does happen to you, they will be dying to make you sign a very, very long lease of one the magnificent crypts with a view of the Antinau Sea.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Sufokia</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sufokia is a magnificent city whose wooden walkways extend far into the Antinau Sea. The panoramic view delights crowds of fishermen who smell of the sea and Grawns.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It has been said that this city is, in fact, only the emerging part of an immense city built in the past by a civilisation that has long since disappeared...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It is also said that Sufokia was built by the shrewd Buzinessemanh so the Bontarian and Brakmarian warriors could take a break from their perpetual quarrelling, treat each other to a holiday and spend their kamas. Unfortunately for him, this proposal was the last he would ever utter.

This late addition explains why we don't really know much about Pandala Island and the Pandawas who live on it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Known for its bamboo-based fermented drinks, Pandala can be divided into 6 large zones: at the centre, Pandala Village, populated by kind souls and drunken locals, and the 4 villages of Aerdala, Akwadala, Terrdala and Feudala, surrounding it. These villages boast exceptional resources and are coveted by Bontarian and Brakmarian warriors who treat the land like a tug of war.</p>\n<p>The last area, the Nolifis peninsula, lies to the far north-east of Pandala. This peninsula was deserted by the Pandawas themselves: they call Nolifis the land of their ancestors and believe that the ghosts of Pandawas who died in battle haunt the island. They're not wrong either: you will need a lot of experience, courage and friends to dare to venture there.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>My geographic research shows that the five villages co-existed in harmony until the council, directed by Grandapan, decided to open up the island to the rest of the world...</p>\n<p>Grandapan's decision would put an end to an era of peace and harmony: the Aerdala and Feudala Pandawas rose against the council's decision, so adventurers are welcomed there, but with varying degrees of warmth. As for the Pandikazes, the independent freedom fighters, they're just plain hostile towards adventurers!</p>\n<p>A minority of Lenalds, cousins of those from Wabbit Island, also live on Pandala.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Resistance is the Pandawas' speciality: the effectiveness of their shields has been proven beyond all doubt and their understanding of the elements is world renowned.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The Imp Village</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Imps are the masters of the air, and the only thing more formidable than their gift for mechanics is their foul temper. Their flying naves, steerable balloons and other aerostats will delight warriors from guilds of all sizes. Indeed, the alliances are constantly arguing over who has control of the village so they can benefit from its advantages... If you have been dubbed Newtroll Knight, take a hike, you won't be able to use the famous Imp Carriers!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The Dopple Village</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Dopples are creatures who have retreated to the western lands, but their destiny was to conquer the world!</p>\n<p>Their origins remain shrouded in mystery. It would appear the Dopples used to be followers who had rejected their own gods to venerate Rushu, the Demon Lord. Rushu planned to use the Dopples to raise an army and launch a powerful attack... But the result wasn't as good as expected! Noisy and disorganised, the wave of Dopples broke against the resistance of the inhabitants of Amakna. Rushu, who wanted to create his disciples in his image, found himself landed with Dopples: quite unpleasant, slightly demonic creatures who have never quite forgotten their allegiance to their original gods.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>As a form of penitence, the Dopples are regularly captured and locked in temples to try to reconvert them by force. Pious adventurers can take their anger out on a Dopple between prayers... It's actually considered a good form of training!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some of the stones they have in their possession are indispensable for making valuable weapons and equipment!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>City of Bonta</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The north-west of the <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Cania Plains</span> prides itself on housing one of the most beautiful cities in the world: Bonta, city of Good and Justice. Built by the protectors Jiva, Pouchecot and Menalt to counter Rushu's growing power, Bonta has never yielded to Brakmar, its great rival.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, those in power in Bonta seem to have renounced the ideals that they were supposed to defend! And, nowadays, Bontarians are torn between their quest for good, the defence of the oppressed and the thirst for power...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If, one day, you decide to serve the city of Bonta, be inspired and think hard about the commitment you're making. You might believe that you're spilling the enemy's blood for Good and Justice, but you might only be serving the designs of some war- and power-hungry fanatics!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Bonta's armed groups are split into different rival militias and guilds, which only unite to fight against Brakmar the Dark.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Either way, Bonta is a splendid city, an architectural delight of stones and light. If you do decide you want to become one of the city's soldiers, a series of quests awaits you. You will be introduced to Bontarian principles and ideology, and you might even become a White Winged warrior!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The Cania Plains</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These vast plains stretch as far as the eye can see south and east of Bonta. A few small farms are evidence of the crops that they attempt to grow there.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On the other hand, Cania is a real paradise for petty thieves, who will find Blops, Kanigers and Plisskens there in abundance. It's almost as if a curse has increased the libido of these creatures, just like the one that affected the Jellies in the past.</p>\n<p>Although the road is paved and easy to walk on, even without boots on, it is not very safe. Old tales tell of <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Eratz the Protester</span>, <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Nomekop Wodly</span> ad <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Edasse the Killjoy</span>, bandits who would have a field day with adventurers passing through with their plump purses. As for the rest, they're likely to pass from life to death, trembling with fear, which isn't very glorious, I must admit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Cania</span> Massif is the home of the Plain Cracklers, the distant, less sophisticated cousins of the Cracklers. In other words, they're not really the sort of creatures one associates with.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>At the north of Cania, almost next to Bonta, Lord Crow regularly opens his home to adventurers. Known for his inhospitality, Lord Crow will receive you however he likes, thank you very much. It's the early bird that catches the worm, and Lord Crow gets up each morning at the crack of dawn, so you'd better have your wits about you if you want to defeat him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cania Forest is found to the east, and is home to the Plain Boars. It seems the plains don't agree with the boars, because they are even more scowling than their forest-dwelling cousins.</p>\n<p>To the north, you'll find Bonta Cemetery. Tombs, crypts and vaults in the purest Bontarian style are home to a whole family of Chafers: Chafer Archers, Chafer Lancers and Elite Chafers clink their bones together with an eerie musicality while telling stories that will make the hairs on your head stand on end (which is saying a lot, since the Chafer family is bald).</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>City of Brakmar</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Situated to the south-west of the Sidimote Moors, which are themselves south of the Cania Plains, Brakmar has a very distinctive sulphuric smell.</p>\n<p>Hyrkul, Djaul's favourite demon, built this city with the aim of imposing Rushu the Demon Lord's sovereignty.</p>\n<p>A short while afterwards, Jiva, Menalt and Pouchecot, the protectors of the months of Javian, Martalo and Frauguctor, founded Bonta in order to counter Rushu's growing power. A terrible battle broke out between the defenders of the two rival cities: the Crimson Dawn. This battle cemented the hatred between the two camps, which still exists today.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Policy-wise, the Brakmarian code of honour is the same as the one followed by supporters of Bonta. Of course, you'll feel more at home if you like the black forces, darkness and all the assorted sets (horns, yellow eyes, fangs, scary laugh and Bwork breath).</p>\n<p>As Bonta's rival, Brakmar recruits new warriors by the dozen to go and pluck the feathers off those <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>White Wings</span>. Training is reasonably long, though: only the strongest and most able recruits will be able to earn the <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Red Wings</span> worn by the Brakmarian Warriors.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The Sidimote Moors</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The light struggles to shine through the noxious clouds that overshadow the Sidimote Moors. It must be this lack of light that gives that deathly pallor to the Scurvion and the indigenous wolves we call <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Whitish Fangs</span>. Once you're there, you won't get any paler. Now green, on the other hand...</p>\n<p>In the Cemetery of the Tortured you might hit a snag, or worry yourself sick! Ghosts, vampires and Chafers all frolic about there in the hope that they will find some adventurers who will want to live out the rest of their days and beyond in their company.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Further to the north-east lies Gisgoul, the Devastated Village. Bworks, Goblins and Karne Riders live in the ruins of this recently very sought-after village. It makes you wonder why? The area could become quite popular again. Indeed, Rushu's cult is celebrated in the high tower of Gisgoul, the Demon Lord's followers are growing every day and the Rogues are flooding in.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The Treechnid Forest</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a very strange forest whose trees exude perfumed fragrances, whilst the Treechnids bombard the amateur ramblers with Arachnees. Located to the north of Amakna Village, it's the zone marked out in red on most adventurers' maps. As for the local wildlife, you can imagine the scene: Dark Treechnids fight for territory with (not so dark) Treechnids and there's no doubt that they'll whip you with their leafy branches if you poke your nose into their family affairs. This fight amongst species also affects the insects. The Common Arachnee, previously a common species in our country, can now only be found in a few secluded parts of the forest. There are Major Arachnees (<span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Arakneus Majoris</span> for the Scrabblus enthusiasts among you) all over the place.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There's a rumour that an evil heart beats deep within the forest. And that those who've been there also suffer from his curse!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The Evil Forest</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Legend has it that a labyrinth was made in this forest by the Kwismas Minotoball on his way back from his annual outing. He'd drunk a little more than usual and thought it would be funny to break down the forest the way other people break match sticks.</p>\n<p>This legend has completely confused the academics: that would mean that the labyrinth, which is situated in southern Amakna, would have been made by Minotoball on his way back from Brakmar? Yet, it's very well-known that Brakmarian children are anything but good! Well? The mystery remains unsolved!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>But let's return to the labyrinth. As its name indicates, it's labyrinthine. The creatures that haunt it are aggressive and will attack you shamelessly if you don't show them a great deal of respect. Marvellous popular wisdom translates this as: <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>In the maze, he who expels noxious gases will end up breaking far more than wind...</span></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>But, most importantly, this is one of the few places where lumberjacks can harvest the rare ebony wood. It would seem that one of the Dofus guardians chose to live there, that same place that Crail, the famous Feca master and Arty's grandfather, fought in the prime of his youth.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class6 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"130":{"id":130,"typeId":1,"titleId":"How to Become a Bontarian Inductee","authorId":"<b>Amayiro</b>","subTitleId":"Rules to Follow","contentId":"<p>Alignment Advantages: p. 3</p>\n<p>Shields: p. 6</p>\n<p>Choosing Your Side: p. 7</p>\n<p>Ranks and Honour Points: p. 8</p>\n<p>Disgrace Points: p. 9</p>\n<p>Disabling PvP Mode: p. 10</p>\n<p>Territory Conquests: p. 11</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>Alignment Advantages</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you start your adventure, your character is neutral.

To do this, he completed the quests that were offered to him in one of the two cities.

Each time you rise in rank, your wings (which represent your alignment) will grow a little bigger.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For fights that take place between several players of different alignments, the Honour Points awarded are calculated for the whole team. Then the points are distributed in proportion to the PvP ranks of each team member.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The total points awarded are calculated using the difference in overall team rank (the sum of all the players' PvP ranks) between the winners and the losers.

Their attack power can be <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>high although somewhat uncertain,</span> or <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>average and stable,</span> depending on the character's skills.</p>\n<p>Cras are real sharpshooters who can shoot from a distance or from up close... and their shots don't half sting! Their range is obviously very large.</p>\n<p>Any Cra worthy of their good name can weaken enemies from a distance, repel enemies, and take some of their enemies' Action Points away.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>ECAFLIP</span> disciples are damage dealers who love taking chances. Their attack power is <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>very high when in close combat but uncertain from a distance.</span> Ecaflips can make hidden things appear, which can be very useful when there are traps concealed on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>To beginners, Ecaflips may seem hard to play, but, as their power increases with experience, they can eventually become every bit as fearsome as Iops.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>ENIRIPSA</span> disciples are healers. Their attack power is therefore weak, as is their range.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Healing allies and giving them Action Points</span> is what Eniripsas do best!</p>\n<p>Eniripsas are valued in groups for their abilities, but are easy targets when they're alone!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>ENUTROF</span> disciples decrease the abilities of other fighters. <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Their attack power is relatively weak,</span> so they're more effective in a team than they are fighting alone. Enutrofs are not easy characters to begin with, but are a very interesting choice for more experienced players!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>FECA</span> disciples are born protectors. Although <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>their attack power is average and quite uncertain,</span> they can provide powerful protection for their allies, as well as for themselves. Fecas can withstand a lot more damage than any other class, but in return, they are weak attackers.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>IOP</span> disciples are mighty fighters. Subtlety is most definitely NOT their middle name; they're here to do damage, and they do it well! <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Their range is low but their attack power is very high when in close combat.</span></p>\n<p>Their skills also include increasing their allies' damage and taking Movement Points away from their enemies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>OSAMODAS</span> disciples can summon creatures. Their <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>attack power and range are both medium,</span> but they can summon creatures to wear enemies down, remove some of their Action Points, or push them away. Born for summoning, their fighting style is based around these creatures.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>SACRIER</span> disciples master their pain to make themselves stronger. <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>When in close combat, their power is high...</span> provided they take the first hit! Their range is average, but they can pull adversaries towards them to defeat them in close combat. Sacriers are quite a hard class for novices to master.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>SADIDA</span> disciples are mages who influence movement and immobility. <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Their attack power is quite high but uncertain,</span> at least at the beginning of their training. They have medium range. Their Summons include creatures that explode, block the way, or remove Action Points; and they have various ruses to prevent adversaries from moving around.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>SRAM</span> disciples are just like their god: sly master strategists. Their attack power is <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>extremely high in close combat</span> and <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>medium from a distance.</span></p>\n<p>Srams can make allies invisible, push enemies back and make the invisible visible.</p>\n<p>Thanks to their versatility and strategic skills, they can get out of most any situation!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>XELOR</span> disciples are time masters. <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Their attack power is average but their range is high.</span> Disciples of this class are quite efficient on their own and extremely fearsome when in groups. They know just how to take Action Points away from their enemies and give some to their allies.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>PANDAWA</span> disciples have no trouble playing around with gravity. They can lift enemies clean off their feet and send them soaring through the air. <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Their attack power is high but their range is quite low.</span> They are much appreciated in groups for their lifting and throwing abilities.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Members of the <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>ROGUE</span> clan are demolition experts. They place bombs all over the battlefield, leading to <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>explosions with devastating effects – especially when more than one bomb goes off at once!</span> Rogues can also support their allies. <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Their range is medium,</span> and their gameplay is tactical, so they could be complicated for beginners.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>MASQUERAIDERS</span> use their magic masks to switch roles depending on the situation. <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Their range and attack power vary</span> depending on whether they're playing the Coward or the Psychopath. With their third mask on, they can prevent enemies from fleeing. This versatility makes Masqueraiders quite hard for beginners to master.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>FOGGERNAUTS</span> are tacticians and experts at technomagic. They <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>place turrets to arrange the battlefield</span> to their advantage. Foggernauts can <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>take on several roles,</span> but they have to choose one to be effective when fighting. Their war machines can affect allies as well as enemies, so the key to success is <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>being able to control the field.</span></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>Fighting</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Fighting relies on a <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>turn-based system,</span> which means that, each turn, players play one after the other within a limited amount of time (30 seconds each). Place your character at the beginning of the fight, move, hit, cast spells... It's up to you to build your own strategy!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Choosing a good starting spot</span> for your character can give you a significant advantage. Once you've played, or once you've placed your character, don't forget to <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>end your turn</span> by clicking on the arrow under your portrait.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Tip:</span></p>\n<p>When you start a fight, you can decide to <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>exclude</span> other players. You can also <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>call for help</span> from other adventurers. Up to seven other players can <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>join the fight</span> before it's actually started. Just click on the icons to the right of your screen when a fight is launched.</p>\n<p>You can also <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>forbid other players from watching a fight</span> that you have started. This function is especially useful when you're in PvP mode, as it stops other players from analysing your tactics.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>Points Used in Combat</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>HP – Health Points</span></p>\n<p>Your character's Health Points decrease when he or she receives damage (when hit by an enemy attack, for example). They increase when your character is healed (by a spell, an ally or an item). If your character's HP drop to zero, they're dead!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>AP – Action Points</span></p>\n<p>The number of Action Points your fighter has determines how many actions they can perform in a turn. Your different spells and attacks all have a cost in Action Points: attacking with a weapon, for example, often costs 5 AP. Once your character's AP drop to 0, they can't do anything else that turn. Fighters start out with 6 AP, but this total can be increased or reduced by spells and/or equipment.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>MP – Movement Points</span></p>\n<p>Your character's Movement Points determine their potential to move around within a fight. Moving a fighter removes Movement Points from their total MPs. Fighters start out with 3 MP, but this total can be increased or reduced by spells and/or equipment. Each time you move, it costs you 1 or more MP, depending on the number of cells you move.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Special Case:</span> When a fighter is on one of the four squares adjacent to a monster or another fighter, the fighter is said to be in a <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>lock zone</span> (also called a control zone). Escaping a lock zone can result in the loss of a varying amount of AP and MP, depending on the fighters' Agility: the higher the Dodge characteristic of the character who wants to escape the zone (in comparison with the enemy's Lock characteristic), the less they'll be penalised and the further they'll be able to run.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Tip:</span></p>\n<p>Some monsters have more than 3 MP and 6 AP! Certain rare items of equipment can grant you extra AP and MP!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Other points to take into account when fighting:</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>RA – Range</span></p>\n<p>Your character's Range determines the maximum distance that he or she can cast spells. Just like Movement and Action Points, this characteristic can be modified using spells and/or equipment. Range is very important, especially for classes that fight better from a distance, such as Cras.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Initiative</span></p>\n<p>The fighter with the highest Initiative will play first in a fight. If two of them have an equal amount of Initiative, their starting order will be decided at random. Your Initiative remains the same for the whole fight.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Prospecting</span></p>\n<p>Prospecting increases your ability to pick up items at the end of fights. You start the game with 100 Prospecting points (120 for Enutrofs) and you can gain more by equipping items that carry Prospecting bonuses. Increasing your Chance characteristic will also aid your Prospecting skills (+1 Prospecting point for 10 Chance points).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>EP – Energy Points</span></p>\n<p>When your character loses a fight, he or she loses all of their HP and some of their Energy. They will also return automatically to their last saved position (a Zaap, for example, or to Incarnam or Astrub, if they didn't have a saved position).</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>Victory and Defeat</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Death</span></p>\n<p>When you lose a fight and your Energy drops to zero, you join the ghost world. It's now up to you to find a Phoenix to come back to life and regain a little Energy.</p>\n<p>When a player joins the ghost world, the Phoenixes that he or she can go to are all shown by red markers on the general map. If this happens to you, you can either wait to be resuscitated by a player who is able to do so, or go and find the nearest Phoenix.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Winning Fights</span></p>\n<p>Winning fights against monsters allows you to gain experience, pick up items, and even earn a few kamas. All this will help you on your way to buying new equipment and spells that you think are the best choice, which is the best way to develop your character... and that's where DOFUS starts to get tactical! You can also sell the items you find by rummaging through the remains of defeated monsters to earn some more kamas, the currency in the World of DOFUS.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>Elements and Characteristics</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Each element corresponds to a characteristic. Spells and certain items of equipment are influenced by the elements: mastering these element will increase their spells' and equipment's effects (inflicting more damage, healing more HP, parrying, etc.).</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Earth</span> and Neutral correspond to <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Strength</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Water</span> corresponds to <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Chance</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Air</span> corresponds to <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Agility</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Fire</span> corresponds to <span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Intelligence</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Other Characteristics</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Vitality</span> determines how many HP your character has.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Wisdom</span> enables you to gain experience more easily, parry AP and MP losses, and reduce enemies' AP and MP more easily – as well as increasing the power of rebound spells (such as Xelors' <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Counter</span> spell).</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>Spells</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Spells have various effects that you must learn to control for them to be effective: healing, summoning creatures, reducing an enemy's MP, increasing an ally's AP... There are many different combinations! Some spells also inflict damage or increase your damage output. Like weapons, each spell has its own range and an area of effect.</p>\n<p>Note: if a spell is Neutral, its effects can be strengthened by the Earth characteristic.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>Bonuses and Damage Reduction</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Damage can be increased (boosted by damage bonuses) or reduced (by resistance bonuses) depending on the element of your weapon (or of your spells, if you have chosen attack spells) and your items.</p>\n<p>You should choose damage and resistance bonuses to match the element of your weapon and/or spells.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For instance, let's take a Sacrier fighter equipped with:</p>\n<p>- a cloak that increases EARTH damage by 10,</p>\n<p>- headgear that increases EARTH damage by 15, and</p>\n<p>- the <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Sacrier's Foot</span> spell (an EARTH spell that inflicts between 10 and 18 damage).</p>\n<p>Each time the Sacrier hits, they inflict between 35 and 43 damage on their opponent, if the opponent has no resistances.</p>\n<p>If the spell <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Sacrier's Foot</span> is replaced by the Raziel (a sword that inflicts between 26 and 40 Neutral damage), each of the Sacrier's blows will inflict as much damage on an opponent, minus any resistances.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>Critical Hits and Critical Failures</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Each blow struck and spell cast is subject to Critical Hits (CH) and Critical Failures (CF). The difference or increase in effects caused by a Critical Hit is indicated in the description of each weapon and spell.</p>\n<p>A Critical Failure always inflicts zero damage, whereas a Critical Hit will considerably increase your chances of inflicting much more damage than usual.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>Equipment</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The items that your character can equip are divided into a number of categories:</p>\n<p>- Pets and mounts</p>\n<p>- Dofus</p>\n<p>- Clothes (cloaks, hats, boots, etc.)</p>\n<p>- Jewellery (amulets, rings, etc.)</p>\n<p>- Weapons</p>\n<p>- Shields</p>\n<p>- Other</p>\n<p>Each equippable item can grant you stat bonuses, damage and/or resistance bonuses, Range/AP/MP bonuses, etc. Discover them all!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Special Case: Sets</span></p>\n<p>A full outfit of equippable items (boots, cloak, headgear, etc.) – often all dropped by the same monster – is known as a <span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>set.</span> Sets give special effects to whoever wears them. These vary from set to set (Gobball, Prespic, Boar, Moskito, etc.), but they are usually well worth the effort (bonuses for stats, HP, etc.). The more parts of a set you have, the higher the overall bonus, so get collecting now! So if you're missing part of a set, make sure you find it so you can get the highest bonus possible!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'><b>In the same series and by the same author:</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Beginner's Manual</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>How to Become the Perfect Recruit</span></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>How to Make Friends and Keep Them</span></p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\n.document_content2_es-class8 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class6 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class7 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n"},"134":{"id":134,"typeId":1,"titleId":"-","authorId":"and to Hujikan, Doux-Leurre, Madahine","subTitleId":"-","contentId":"<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Preface</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the year 636, the Bards measured their talents with quills and texts.

He sees that he is in the middle of the streets of Astrub, in front of the statue of Sram.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Nolliuos</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I would have liked to tell you a story in the style of \"Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away...\" Only what I'm about to tell you isn't more than twenty-four hours old. I don't even know if \"Once upon a time\" is an adequate introduction, as my tale is so far removed from any fairy tale that us Eniripsas are accustomed to telling.</p>\n<p>This place we are in, in front of the statue of the god Sram, is quite fitting for my story. Deceit, betrayal, women not wearing much... Yes, my past is worthy of the everyday life of a Sram. Am I boring you? You're right, what's the point in spouting on about the nature of my story, if I'm not even going to bother telling you the story?</p>\n<p>So, once upon a time, yesterday morning, there was a young Eniripsa – full of life, panache and mistresses. Aaaah, Miss Tigry...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>There's her portrait, just next to my foot. My apologies that I can't hand it to you, but her idiot husband wasn't exactly delicate with my wing. Oh dear... what would become of my immoral life if he knew that I've got the habit of ending up in his wife's arms before every lunchtime?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oh, I know what you're thinking. She's too old for me. But I'll tell you one thing: a middle-aged Ecaflip woman is worth more than three Fecas who exude a love of life. It was even me who ended up begging for mercy! So much delight... it was almost obscene!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Why did the cuckold lay into me? Oh, that's quite simple. You see that Twiggy shovel there? Just under the cloak? Well I had the misfortune of borrowing it from him without asking him first. And all that because a young Iop girl who was a bit cracked (yes, it's a euphemism) asked me to go and dig up some Earth Bwak eggs. You think I'm bonkers, don't you? But she was so stunning in her Brakmarian cloak, her long black hair getting mixed up in the fabric, her almond eyes, pointed breasts, narrow waist... and those legs, oh those legs! Never ending! No one could deny those thighs anything.</p>\n<p>Of course the idea of finding Bwak eggs by digging at the foot of the mountains made me laugh... But what wouldn't I have done to taste that mad Iop's forbidden fruit!?</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>But you know what's worst? She was right. We did indeed find eggs when digging... freshly laid, what's more. When I asked her what she was going to do with the eggs, it was in that moment that I understood exactly how stupid Iops are. Oh I love them, don't get me wrong... especially naked. But all the same, to eat Earth Bwak eggs, you've got to be cooked in the head, and have a stomach that's both bigger than a Pandikaze and made from Lousy Pig leather! So if you're wondering about this empty shell just in front of you, don't worry: its inhabitant also ended up getting cooked...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>No really, it was a spectacular day. Full of laughs, surprises and craziness...</p>\n<p>In the evening, we ended up here at Sram's feet, with a few flasks of Pandapills that my charming Iop companion had made sure to bring with us. We were blind drunk, singing \"Pandapills, Pandapills, tralalalalah\" at the top of our voices, when Miss Tigry and her lawful husband arrived. Furious at seeing me more drunk with a Iop who was younger than her, she didn't take long to find a way to exact her revenge:</p>\n<p>\"Oh, darling! Your Twiggy shovel!\"</p>\n<p>\"You little midge! You're the one who stole it from me!\"</p>\n<p>I didn't have time to stagger to somewhere safe: he'd already grabbed the shovel and started hitting me with it. Falling to my beautiful Iop's knees, I saw the contents of my bag emptied in front of her, allowing her to see the letter from the Bontarian Army – a summons to enlist with them.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>I saw the sense of betrayal in my sweetheart's blue eyes. She drank one last, long mouthful of Pandapills, and threw the flask right in my face. After a few kicks to my already broken wing, she left... without even taking her cloak...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Hujikan</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*Sound of a tom-tom being hit frantically*</p>\n<p>- Abawana, Abawana...</p>\n<p>- Oh look, travellers!</p>\n<p>- Good day to you, brave adventurers! I, Huji-ji the Pandawa poet, would like to tell you the story of the fabulous Flith-Voyth, the amnesiac Eniripsa.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*Long musical interlude on a tambourine, lute, and another carnival instrument*</p>\n<p>- There once was an Eni most fair, who was found passed out in the square. When he finally stirred, his memory was blurred, and he didn't know how he'd got there!</p>\n<p>And a damaged shovel was found, stuck straight upright in the ground – it called to mind an old spoon, so rough and shoddy was it hewn. Without waiting, he rose from the ground, looked left, right, and all around. His wing seemed to him injured, from a cause not quite remembered. And though he thought til his thinker was sore, he had no idea what the fates had in store.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>*Takes a breath*</p>\n<p>- And he'd roamed 'round the town, picking up many items he found. But little did they assuage his stress, and were by and large quite worthless... A broken shell, its host long fled. A jet black cloak from which evil bled. An Eca's picture in a beat-up frame. The seal of a serviceman of notable fame.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*Resumes playing the lute with calm and innocence*</p>\n<p>- The poor Eniripsa with the memory rent... had met a soldier with a missive from Bonta sent!</p>\n<p>- The dire cloak had attracted the stoic soldier's stare; and 'twas by this cloak that he dragged our hero through the square!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>- The saintly man then stopped – in the City of Mercenaries, those hailing from Bonta or Brakmar had best be wary. So be it! Resigned, he looked 'round, then gently set our Eni down.</p>\n<p>- The man doubtless understood this charade, and our hero questioned him 'neath the arcade.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*Takes a breath and resumes his singing with even greater intensity*</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>- They were face to face, before the Kikim Inn, the Eni'd cheated the barkeep... So he fled, joined the enemy. This letter was brought by a Piwi, running toward danger deep. So drunk was our man, his vision beset, he called on a man who he'd never met. The Brakmarian soldier read the note and the name there signed, and tried to cut the nurse, who fled someplace hard to find. He surely felt safe there in a deep and infamous mine. But the overworked miners who chased him were far from benign. Our fairy had no option but to beat them blue with a shovel he'd found that looked rather new.</p>\n<p>- And now it seemed his only option was to flee from all the workers so bitter and angry. Once he finally found his way out, he was surprised by a Kwak, giant and stout! Drunk and afraid, he did something dumb, and took from the beast her feathery young.</p>\n<p>- The Bontarian was well-hidden, and watched this all unfold, before knocking the Eni out, and sending him to the hold.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>- But through luck, a slow Sram released the fairy, in place of the boss he'd been sent to free.</p>\n<p>- The poor Eni, now verging on sobriety, was abandoned 'neath the statue of a certain sneaky deity...</p>\n<p>- The moral of this story is: If you stop at Kikim Inn for a glass, Sram might show up, so best watch your...self.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>*didiliiiing dliiiiiing*</p>\n<p>Oh alright, I'll go back to my tavern...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Doux-Leurre</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With a groan, Oligo the Eniripsa got back to his feet. He didn't know how long he'd been unconscious, but his right wing and his head were hurting really badly, and his stomach was complaining with hunger. With a grimace, he looked around him, and realised that he was in Astrub, at the foot of the statue of the god Sram. It seemed to be staring at him teasingly. Night had fallen, and the few people who went by hardly even glanced at him.</p>\n<p>\"But what am I doing here?\" he asked himself. \"And what is...\"</p>\n<p>Several items were scattered at his feet, so he bent down to pick them up and examine them: a Twiggy shovel, a Brakmarian cloak, a photo, a letter, and a sort of large eggshell, as black as burnt ebony.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>These trifling things seemed familiar, but he couldn't remember anything from the previous few days. In a lantern's light, he examined the photo: there was quite an old Ecaflip, looking relaxed, sat on a wooden log, in front of what seemed to be some treetops. He put it in his pocket, and read the letter. It told him that he had been invited to meet Just Issforowl, a captain of the Bontarian Guard. Deciding to find out how he has arrived in Astrub in as bad a shape as a Poutch Ingball, he gathered his things up, and headed towards the west, towards the majestic Bonta.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The fortifications of the beautiful City were visible to him at daybreak. He sped up. Once he reached the gates after twenty minutes or so, a member of the Militia came up to him and blocked his path.</p>\n<p>\"Who goes there!?\"</p>\n<p>With the most important appearance as his aching body would allow, Oligo held the letter to the soldier's face.</p>\n<p>\"I must see the captain, Just Issforowl, for some business of the utmost importance!\"</p>\n<p>The guardian, recognising the stamp on the letter, stepped aside.</p>\n<p>After finding his bearings thanks to the advice of a few Bontarians and with the help of his official pass, the young Eniripsa arrived at the door of the captain's office, knocked, and entered. A gigantic Iop turned around, and seeing Oligo, opened his eyes wide and rushed at him.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Oligo! Have you come back alone? Where are Imar, Srever and Flechevive? Do you have the egg? Are you hurt?\"</p>\n<p>\"Sir, I came here hoping to find some answers, not questions...\"</p>\n<p>\"What do you mean?\"</p>\n<p>\"I woke up in Astrub last night; I don't know who you are, I barely even know who I am, but I was hoping that you'd be able to shed some light on my situation, because in my things, there was... this letter.\"</p>\n<p>The captain took the letter from him.</p>\n<p>\"Well of course, that's your summons. Do you mean to say that you're amnesiac?\"</p>\n<p>The Iop's worry was written all over his face.</p>\n<p>\"Absolutely, sir.\"</p>\n<p>Looking aggrieved, Just Issforowl fell down into his chair.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"It's a disaster... You were gone for sixteen days. As I'm speaking to you, the Brakmarians have surely got their hands on the egg.\"</p>\n<p>Oligo grabbed the black shell that he'd been keeping in his saddlebag.</p>\n<p>\"Do you mean this?\"</p>\n<p>\"By Jiva,\" exclaimed the captain, \"the Black Egg! It's empty?\"</p>\n<p>Oligo, with a piece of the shell in each hand, shrugged his shoulders.</p>\n<p>\"Could you finally tell me who I am, and what I'm doing with this shell, cloak, and shovel in my belongings?\"</p>\n<p>Just Issforowl turned towards the large window the sun was shining through, which lit up his heavily-scarred face.</p>\n<p>\"You are Oligo, a Tweasuwe Huntew. One of the best. I was ordered to hire you and Imar, another hunter, an Ecaflip, to find the Black Egg before the Brakmarian troops.\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Djaul knows what would happen if it fell into the wrong hands... You were being assisted in your task by two mercenaries: Flechevive, a Cra, and Srever, a Sram. Their feats of arms are well-known, and I'd be surprised if your mission failed with such talent at your side.\"</p>\n<p>\"What's this black egg?\"</p>\n<p>\"It is said in the sacred texts of the Bonta Library, that every ten-thousandth new moon, the legendary Black Kwak comes out of its underground sanctuary and lays an egg. It is also written that...\"</p>\n<p>The captain didn't have time to finish his sentence before someone knocked at his door. An Ecaflip slid into the room. Oligo instantly recognised her as the one from the photo. She only seemed half surprised to see him in the captain's office.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Her face and clothes, real, full of light and not at all discoloured by time, suddenly made the Eniripsa's memory return: the black egg and the power that the coveted Black Bwak gave to its bearer; meeting White Jackie, the Bontarian scout posted in the Imp Village; camouflaging the group using Brakmarian cloaks; the two days and nights spent digging for the egg in the Sidimote Moors; finding it, and the foul betrayal by Srever the Sram, and his accomplices hidden in the undergrowth.</p>\n<p>\"Captain. Oligo. I suppose you've told the captain about our misadventures?\"</p>\n<p>\"But what are you doing here?\" exclaimed the Captain. \"Why aren't you continuing your mission?\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"There is no more mission, sir. The Brakmarians set an ambush, orchestrated by Srever. He took hold of the egg after we found it and dug it up. He was in league with the Brakmarian troops from the start... Flechevive has been captured, and Imar is...\"</p>\n<p>Outside, the warning trumpets sounded abruptly. The Iop jumped, his hand already on the sheath of his giant sword. Surprised, Oligo fell into step behind him, followed by White Jackie. They climbed the stairs of the ramparts four by four, and what they saw rooted them to the spot.</p>\n<p>A hundred or so Brakmarian soldiers on Whitish Fangs were rushing towards the City in a cloud of dust, screaming.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n</p>But the most impressive thing was the gigantic dark-coloured Bwak leading them, tearing at the blue morning sky with its hellish wingspan, with a hooded Sram on its back, holding a short-sword gleaming with magic in each hand.<p>\n<p>\"Tremendous,\" White Jackie sighed unavoidably.</p>\n<p>\"Archers, to your stations!\" screamed the captain, smiling with excitement despite the horror that this monstrous image inspired in him. He unsheathed his gleaming blade and hurtled down the stairs, without stopping to shout orders at his men, frozen with terror. He surreptitiously thought that it was the last time he'd trust a Sram.</p>\n<p>When the first Whitish Fangs reached the south gate of Bonta, Oligo remembered the teasing stare of the Sram statue in Astrub, and started praying.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Mahadine</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"Hey, wake up!\"</p>\n<p>\"Hhhmmmmm... Mum, I'm sleeping, leave me alone!\"</p>\n<p>\"Get up!\"</p>\n<p>An Eniripsa is sprawled out on the floor. A Cra girl is on her knees next to him, trying to wake him up. The Eniripsa opens his eyes, and makes a slight movement of surprise: he's lying down on the cobblestones in a dark street of the World...</p>\n<p>\"Where am I?\" he mumbles, looking lost.</p>\n<p>\"You're in Astrub. You know, the most populous village in the region...\" the young Cra says ironically. She hesitates, then adds:</p>\n<p>\"So... Are you lost, little guy? Do you want me to help you find your mum?\"</p>\n<p>\"Do I look like a little kid to you?\" the Eniripsa replies, blushing.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"That's easy to say! All Eniripsas have childlike faces...\"</p>\n<p>He sighs. \"I don't remember anything,\" he suddenly says out loud, breaking the Cra's awkward silence.</p>\n<p>He looks around. He sees some Srams jeering, looking at him from next to a strange statue, smiling. He has a piece of crumpled paper in his hands, and is sat on a piece of dark fabric. He reads the paper:</p>\n<p>\"I, Amayiro, head of the Bontarian militia, attest that from this day, the 28 of Frauguctor 636, the Soldier S. U'PEWWY is reassigned to the contingent of the Bontarian militia.\"</p>\n<p>\"U'Pewwy? As in Sumry U'Pewwy, the author of <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>The Little Trinkess</span>?\" asked the Cra, who had also read the piece of paper.</p>\n<p>\"U'Pewwy is a Wabbit... And his book is called <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>The Little Twinkess</span>, you ignoramus. Do I look like a bunny or what?\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Agh! Not so amnesiac after all! He can flaunt his literary culture, but can't even be bothered to remember his name!\"</p>\n<p>The Eniripsa tries to get up.</p>\n<p>\"Ouch! My left wing, it hurts...\"</p>\n<p>\"Which one?\"</p>\n<p>\"The left one, I told you!\"</p>\n<p>\"You have two sets of wings, idiot. Your Eniripsa wings and some little white wings, there...\" she explains calmly, accidentally gripping the angelic left wing.</p>\n<p>\"OWEEEE! Be careful, will you?\"</p>\n<p>\"Oh hey! I'm a warrior you know. Not an Enursiripsa. You on the other hand don't look like much of a great warrior... here's your weapon, it was lying around next to you,\" she adds, holding out a Twiggy shovel.</p>\n<p>\"\"Huh...? Err, thanks,\" he replies, incensed, looking at the shovel.</p>\n<p>\"I also found some Bwak egg shells, and... this.\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The Cra holds out a picture of an old, clever-looking Ecaflip to him. Without so much as knowing who she was, the Eniripsa suddenly feels ill, turns pale, and curtly grabs the picture from the surprised Cra's hands, then shouts:</p>\n<p>\"Don't dare touch that again!\"</p>\n<p>The Eniripsa's scream cut short the conversations, and the passers-by looked at him, surprised. He awkwardly tries to get up, but the sudden movement revives the pain in his wing, and he can't manage to move.</p>\n<p>\"It looks like you're suffering,\" the young Cra sympathises with him in a compassionate tone. \"Come over here, you might be able to lie down,\" she says, pointing out an unsold house joined to the walls.</p>\n<p>She picks up the dark cloth, then under the teasing watch of Sram, takes the Eniripsa inside, and sits him down on the bed. Then, she starts meticulously combing every nook and cranny of the room.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"What are you doing there?\" he enquired, disappointed.</p>\n<p>\"I'm checking that no one's listening in on us,\" she replies with a calm voice.</p>\n<p>\"Errr, you aren't thinking that you and me are...\"</p>\n<p>\"No,\" she stops him. \"Don't worry. I'm Bontarian too. Tell me... the fact of your white wing being broken leads me to think that you've fought a Brakmarian... And yet, the divine statues in Astrub generate a zone of non-aggression.\" She stops for a second, just long enough to observe the Eniripsa's face. \"A Brakmarian, of a similarly low level to you, was murdered not far from here yesterday. It's you who killed him, am I right?\"</p>\n<p>The Eniripsa suddenly turns very pale. He starts looking slightly worried, as his memories return. \"So, you're...\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"... Mah Taharih, of the Brakmarian Secret Service. My wings are a lure.\" She pauses again, then curtly shouts: \"Come here, you others!\"</p>\n</p>Two warriors appeared from upstairs like a bolt out of the blue, and spread their demonic wings as scare tactics.<p>\n<p>\"Here are Monn and Pehnni, your 'executioners', Mister U'Pewwy... since that's your name. You see, while reading your book, 'The Little Twinkess', I realised that your style was not natural... seeing as it was coded, and you were divulging the names of our agents infiltrating Bonta. Nice idea, hiding code-words in a bestseller. Nice idea too, passing yourself off to your readers as a Wabbit... such a crazy idea that it cleared you of all suspicion.\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Only, you needed proof of your integrity... such as the cloak and plate of one of our spies... whom you murdered yesterday evening, not far from here, and whose cloak is in my hands,\" she delighted, clutching the Brakmarian cloak in a theatrical manner. \"If it reassures you, that duffer will be replaced from tomorrow. As for his plate, you must have hidden it before passing out, but we'll track it down, don't you worry about that. That being said, I don't understand why there were bits of Bwak eggshell near you. On the other hand, this picture...\"</p>\n<p>\"... I recognised her straight away. It's Miss Typhiante, head of the Brakmarian General Staff... since she's been in that position, our failures keep on adding up... but now I understand why, it's because she's a spy as well. Oh, but tell me... Am I right about all this?\"</p>\n<p>\"You... you're wrong!\" stammered U'Pewwy, looking beaten.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Not very convincing. Tell me, did you know that after a sharp, unexpected pain – such as fracturing your wing – you can sometimes lose your memory? It's temporary, of course... you've already recovered yours. But we have ways of erasing it permanently. Killing you would be crude. Spy wars are too refined for that...\"</p>\n<p>The she turned around, and went downstairs. The two warriors forced U'Pewwy to drink a strange potion. Before passing out, he thought: \"Silly girl, your spy's plate is in my accomplice's hands, on his way to Bonta... as for the Bwak egg, it's an antidote that I discovered to your dear \"Memory Potions\"... my memory will come back in a few days' time... You got Miss Typhiante, but she'll laugh...\" then he lost consciousness.</p>\n<p>He woke up the next day, near the statue of Sram, lying down on the cobblestones. He couldn't remember anything.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\n.document_content2_es-class9 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class8 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n.document_content2_es-class10 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class8 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class7 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n"},"135":{"id":135,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Gobtubby","authorId":"<b>Oshimo Bigglip</b>","subTitleId":"How to raise your favourite pet","contentId":"<p>Preface : p1.</p><br> <p>Presentation : p3.</p><br> <p>How to Feed your Pet : p4.</p><br> <p>How to Solve Malnutrition : p5.</p><br> <p>What to do in case of injury : p6.</p><br> <p>Diet of the Gobtubby : p7.</p><br> <p>Fight with your pet : p8.</p><br> <p>Information about Bow Kennels : p10.</p><br> <p>Conclusion : p12.</p><br> <pagefeed/><p class='n'>Unfortunately, as every year, a new sort of plague spead through Amakna.

But the most important of them all is the fleeting feeling that seemed to be by my side all along. This feeling grew, little by little, until it blossomed into an idea and, when I got home, a fully-fledged recipe. I'm a chef. For as long as I can remember, I've loved eating fine food and preparing innovative meals.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>On my travels, I learnt so many recipes that I would never be able to prepare them all again – I just wouldn't have time! But that matters little, as I have already reached the summit of culinary excellence. By carefully mixing together precise quantities of ingredients, I invented the most delicate dish the world has ever known. It may be arrogant of me, but I believe it to be better even than the legendary cosmic meatballs. I named the dish Filtounga, after a Pandawa friend who was the very first to taste my creation.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<p></p>\n<br><p>This name is a word from an indigenous dialect and so I don't know exactly what it means, but I like to tell myself that it represents a cry of enormous, irrepressible happiness. My greatest regret is not having been able to prepare the dish for a second time, because the ingredients are so rare and hard to get hold of.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Filtounga – The Bed of Wild Strawberries</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>Before starting the recipe itself, it's a good idea to arrange things so that the meat doesn't actually touch the dish it's served on. The way to do this is to spread the plate with a thick layer of fruit jelly – strawberry, to be precise; it's the only one that will do. Although you can buy premade jelly, the true epicure will prefer to make their own using freshly gathered strawberries and barley sugar.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>During this stage, I'd advise you to lock your children in their playpen. You don't want the base of the dish smeared with tongue and finger marks.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Filtounga – Preparing the Palate</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Filtounga is an incredibly rich dish. As a result, you absolutely must prepare your palate for the explosion of textures and savours to come. Once you've daubed the plate with strawberry jelly, it's time to cover it in fine slices of brawn embellished with a trickle of lemon juice. Casually scatter a few raw Grawns to absorb the excess lemon. This sumptuous brawn-lemon-Grawn mixture will get your tastebuds fired up for the treat to come. It also looks rather divine.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Filtounga – The Main</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Once you've got this sweet, savoury, delicious bed in place, you can start cooking the meat. For the best results, burn some Ancestral Treechnid wood in a Legendary Crackler stone kiln. Obviously, kitchen equipment of this standard isn't easy to come by, and a common but high-quality oven setup will do almost as well. Select as many choice cuts of Dragomeat as you think you can handle and bring them to the boil in a pan full of walnut oil. Simmer for two minutes or until the kitchen is filled with the subtle stench of Bwork armpits.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Remove the meat from its oily bath and gently pat it dry. Then place it carefully on the dish you prepared earlier.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Filtounga – The Accompaniment</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>The simplest part of making this delicate dish is preparing the accompaniment. Follow the recipe to the letter, because not just any old side dish will do! You'll need mashed potatoes, Babbage leaves, Greedovore flowers and Kraloves. Crush the cooked potatoes by hand. Add the Greedovore flowers to the potatoes and continue to mash until smooth. Once smooth, just spread it in a thick circle around the cooked meat, adding a few Babbage leaves and raw Kraloves here and there for appearance.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Filtounga – The Sauce</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>When you cook the meat, it releases hardly any juices, so you'll need to prepare a sauce. There's only one sauce that really brings out Filtounga's flavour properly, and luckily for you, it's quite easy to make. Melt some squares of dark chocolate. Whilst you're doing that, brown a few onions in the pan. Juice some aubergines. Once the chocolate has completely melted, pour it over the fried onion and add the aubergine juice. Bring the mixture to the boil – when it's ready, it will have taken on a beautiful purplish shade. Add some sesame seeds to the sauce.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br><p>Terrific! The sauce is now ready to pour lovingly over your Dragomeat steaks!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Filtounga – The Drink</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>The dish is now ready... but no meal is complete without a good drink.

Legions of Dreggons have been slaughtered in this part of the world, unfortunately for its inhabitants. It would appear an evil Dofus is behind this scourge... After all, any proper adventurer knows that a Dofus is a dragon egg that a love-struck dragon will offer to his sweetheart. However, it may come as a surprise that these eggs never hatch: that's the key to their draconic power! That's right: keeping the dragons captive in their shells is what makes these eggs so powerful.</p>\n<p>The fact that small dragons (with a fiery temper, despite their diminutive size) have seen the light of day is no doubt the work of an evil genius, or an apprentice getting up to no good with his powers.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Wabbit Island</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Getting to Wabbit Island is easy: all you have to do is take a boat from Amakna Harbour and pay a modest sum to Lily, the rather pretty captain of a boat full of emigrants who leave of their own accord to pillage Wabbit treasures.</p>\n<p>There, you'll find a silky-tailed but oppressed people known as the Lenalds. The island has been invaded by cruel Wabbits, which are kind of like genetically modified Coneys.</p>\n<p>You'll need bravery, strength and healing potions to cross the island and reach the royal residence of the Wa Wabbit. The Wa Wabbit rules his bushy-tailed subjects with an iron paw, like the good tyrant he is. Anything that doesn't look like a female Wabbit or Cawwot from up close or far away disgusts him and, if you plan on entering his castle, you'd better know what you're doing, because the Wobots, the Wa Wabbit's personal bodyguards, will show no mercy!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Moon Island</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To get there, you'll need to contact Charlie's Agents, who will organise the trip for a modest fee.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You'll be greeted by a vision of paradise the minute you first set foot on the fine sandy beach. In the shade of the Kokoko palms, you'll be able to enjoy the scenery while preparing yourself to meet the natives: they've really got living down to a fine art on Moon Island! The pirate LeChouque will receive you in the customary manner and the Kanniballs will surely invite you in for a bite to eat (of what, though, it's best not to ask).</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The seaside might be peaceful enough, but the jungle at the heart of the island is a different story altogether. It's the home of the legendary Moon, of whom, incidentally, very little is known, apart from the fact that he possesses a <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>legendary hammer.</span></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>The Koalak Mountains</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once upon a time, there were four Sadidette sisters who were curious, but not very sensible, who liked to frolic about on the road to Cania, and flirt with the boys. One day, distracted by their innocent games, they were led away by some strapping, leafy young men, and the little group sunk into as yet undiscovered territory, not very far from the Sidimote Moors... it was a very long time ago! What became of the Sadidas, no one knows... As for the Sadidettes, all we know about them is that they took an oath to remain mischievous children forever.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The problem is that, quite a while ago, these young Sadidettes fell far from the tree, as the Sadidas say: they renounced the teachings of the spirits of Nature, much to their parents' displeasure. Over near Sidimote, they met the beautiful, high-spirited Skeunk, an Eniripsa who was an expert in potions and medicinal plants, always accompanied by his Crimson Coney (whose name is Purpole).</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Skeunk became the hidden force behind the four Sadidettes: their mentor. Since then, they've tried a thousand and one ways to use the magic of the gods Sadida and Eniripsa for their own purposes. Their greatest success has been mastering elemental magic to the point where they can each dominate one of the four primordial elements, in the same way as the Elemental Dragons and Pandawushu Masters... Rumour has it that Skeunk stole a precious item from a creature called the Koolich...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>The Dreggon Sanctuary</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A village hidden within another. There is so much more than meets the eye when it comes to the ruins of the old village of Amakna, on the Dreggon Peninsula. They're all that's left of a dramatic history, the remains of a divine punishment inflicted on a people who were too proud for their own good.</p>\n<p>Indeed, underneath this village lies an immense cavern: the Dreggon Sanctuary. Previously, the Dreggons lived there in peace. One day, the inhabitants of Amakna discovered the sanctuary and its dragons. By some genius or madness, they had an insane idea. Worse than that, an idea of sheer lunacy. The first thing that came to their minds when they discovered the existence of these dragons and their sanctuary, hidden from the eyes of the gods, was this: <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>\"Dreggons lay eggs. Dofus are dragon eggs. Dreggons can, therefore, lay Dofus, if we help them to.\"</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>What happened next remains unclear, even to this day.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>This breeding, like the existence of the Sanctuary, became one of their most closely guarded secrets. Things carried on in this way for several generations. One disastrous day, however, the Dreggons decided they no longer wanted people to play with their eggs. They revolted and started massacring their breeders. They felt this was the very least they needed to do to stop their discontent from falling on deaf ears.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The wise men could see ruin and famine coming... The entrance to the sanctuary was condemned and a Kanojedo was built on top of it to conceal their reprehensible activities. But they had underestimated the wrath of the gods!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In one of his manuscripts, the eminent philosopher Platow recalls this sad period of history. Unfortunately, only fragments of this manuscript have been found. Here's one of them:</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>So, the god of gods, Osamodas, who reigns according to the laws and who knows about these sorts of things, noticing the unfortunate state of a race that had been so virtuous, resolved to punish the Dreggon breeders to make them more temperate and wise. To this effect, he brought all of the gods together in their most precious residence, the one that, situated at the centre of the universe, overlooks everything involved in its creation. Having brought them together, told them...\"</span> This extract of Platow's work ends on these words.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In any case, you can be sure that Osamodas spoke to his divine colleagues. And what he said to them that day was not very auspicious for the inhabitants of Amakna. The Sanctuary was reopened by the gods. A wave of Dreggons thirsty for vengeance and massacre descended on Amakna Village... which soon found itself reduced to scraps. The fastest inhabitants were able to flee and hide in what we know today as Amakna Castle. The less fast were all invited to the Dreggon feast, as sausages and steaks, all roasted until burnt to a crisp.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>So, this is how the chapter about the history of the Dreggon Sanctuary ends. A mystery that lives on... Did the breeders get what they were looking for after all? Did they manage to create a Dofus? The mystery has never been solved.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Kwismas Island</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was a Descendre morning in 636 that started off just like any other. Elliot Nagrond, the guardian of the world's north-west lighthouse, showed up, at the top of his workplace as usual. He searched the sea and the horizon, just as usual, watching for the return of the fishermen. However, this morning did not turn out to be like all the others after all, since, as he stared out onto the still faraway and unexplored surface of the ocean, the morning fog lifted and gave way to a new image: a gigantic block of ice in the distance, proud and cold, in the middle of the sea where there had been nothing the previous evening. The rumour of this discovery spread very quickly throughout the whole continent at the same time as an unprecedented cold spell. And it only took one day for all the adventurers, geographers and academics to flock to the coast in the hopes of finding a place on one of the charter boats going to this mysterious island.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>When all the brave voyagers set foot on this new ground, they were taken even further by surprise. Indeed, they discovered that it was far more than just an island on which to spend their winter holidays! There was all sorts of unknown wildlife there... And although the strange creatures that lived there scared the adventurers at first, they soon became a surprising and inexhaustible source of wealth. As a result, all through Descendre, the world's population converged on the island and hunted the local fauna tirelessly. What no one took into account however, was the hunger of Djaul, the demon protector of Descendre!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's right: in spite of appearances, this island was not a gift from the gods! Indeed, Djaul (who took his demonic duties very seriously) was responsible for making the island of ice sail right up next to the Amaknian continent. He was counting on the biting cold to freeze the hearts and souls of the inhabitants of the World of Twelve! And in doing so, the insatiable Djaul hoped to lengthen the month of Descendre...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Yes, his evil desire was to eat into a few days of the month of Javian... But Jiva, the beautiful warrior, defeated the demon, as well as the ice and snow that he brought with him, threatening the whole world. Had Djaul forgotten what Jiva told him, <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>\"He who freezes last freezes best?\"</span> Nobody knows, but he swore he would not give up...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The effervescence surrounding Kwismas Island, which got its name from the date of its discovery, faded as quickly as it had appeared. The adventurers went back to the continent and their normal business. A few academics were, however, interested in the origin of this strange island that had suddenly appeared from nowhere. After all, Djaul must have dragged it from somewhere... One of the many theories was that this was nothing more than a piece of ice that had broken off some faraway, undiscovered continent... The learned Sadida behind this idea, Ougga Lileo, was subjected to mockery and misunderstanding by his peers. As an aside, though, there was one young man who ignored the general scoffing and was interested in Lileo's theory...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>This young man, Kriss Toff, later became a famous pioneer... Which all came down to one simple phrase that, thanks to him, became famous: <span class='document_content2_fr-class8'>\"An ougga in the hand is worth two in the bush.\"</span>.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class8 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class8 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class7 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n"},"147":{"id":147,"typeId":2,"titleId":"Public Notice","authorId":"","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p><img src=\"##jpg,26##\"></p> <p>Public Notice.</p> <br> <p></p> <br> <p></p> <p>I, Cantile, Mayor of Frigost, invite the inhabitants of Frigost to take part in a farming competition.

As you all know, I am a disciple of Xelor. I am convinced that by using Xelor's limitless powers, we can freeze time around the crops. So, once the plants have reached maturity, they will stay that way so we will be able to have as abundant a harvest as possible.\"</p> <p></p> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Jury's decision</span>: This idea will not be chosen because of its unrealistic nature. How would you actually be able to stop time in all Frigost's fields? And what would be the real benefit, as this method would only actually freeze plants at a certain stage of their growth, but would not actually increase growth. And if we were to use the powers of Xelor to accelerate time, we'd have to use it on each plant individually. And for a field of wheat, that could be a little tedious.</p> <pagefeed/> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The good hunter</span></p> <p></p> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Candidate</span>: Clyde Parker</p> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Proposal received</span>:</p> <p>Clyde Parker: \"Hello ladies and gentlemen. Well 'ere's what I think. It's the parasites what are eating at ya. You only 'ave to look at the fields. These beasties go after your crops like an Enu after a kama. So, my idea's this: I'll 'ide in a tree by the fields and BAM! Soon as I see one of 'em beasts move, I'll shoot 'em! And if I don't see 'em move, I'll shoot 'em anyway. I'm a good Cra, me, ya know. I see somethin', I shoot it.\"</p> <p></p> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Jury's decision</span>: Although not very original, this idea has brought to light a very well-known problem for farmers: animals destroying the crops. The solution is to build fences and place scarecrows in the fields.

You're going to understand, it's very simple. Have you ever heard of slash and burn? No? That's a shame, there's nothing more magnificent than fire. Yes, magnificent! We set fire to all these fields and then we replant them. Yes, set fire to everything, that's the answer. Burn it, burn it all... Ahem, excuse me, so, we burn everything, but in a very controlled way, of course. So then everything will grow better. Normally, you'd have to leave the earth to recover for a year, but this is a waste of time. We'll burn everything, all the time! I'll do it if you want. No?\"</p> <p></p> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Jury's decision</span>: Even coming from a Iop, this solution seems a little extreme.

I'll show you. First of all, a little nap, like this...\"</p> <p></p> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Jury's decision</span>: Since after her demonstration of taking a nap, Bea Fortax went to have a lie down, she still hasn't explained the rest of her idea.

All we have to do is dig to extract it, gems, minerals and other precious stones. With the money you make from this, you'll be able to buy whatever you want, including cereals if you like. Since I already have a great deal of experience in this domain, I would be happy to oversee it all. Not just anyone can look for gold, you know.

I hope you will not be offended if I continue to wear this veil for the duration of our meeting. We humble disciples of Sram are accustomed to keeping ourselves masked at all times. Please do not consider it a sign of blatant disrespect. But allow me to come to the point. To overcome our distinguished agricultural rivals from the continent, a very simple solution has appeared to me. With the help of some of my fellow Sram disciples, we could borrow, at a most advantageous tariff, the continental farmers' harvests. I will leave you with the details so as not to take up any more of your precious time. Then, once sufficient time has passed, we can sell on our spoils at a good price.\"</p> <pagefeed/> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Jury's decision</span>: Following the departure of this candidate, the members of the jury spent considerable time looking for certain of the personal effects which seem to have disappeared.

It would be better for you, unless you want to be on the wrong end of my whip.\"</p> <p></p> <p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Jury's decision</span>: Whenever we try to use animals to work in the fields, it always ends up with the same results: some of the crop gets eaten by the animals themselves.

I remember the one about Snow Quiet, who was captured by seven dwarfen mushrooms, or the one about Tom Plum, who got lost in the woods. In these tales, there were always joking spirits, mysterious creatures and enchanted trees more ferocious than Treechnids... They scared me, but it was also fascinating.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's how I fell in love with the Forest and how I became a lumberjack. Well, a lumberjack... It's not really the case, since really I never touched the trees! This place is much too sacred. I would never have risked offending the local spirits! No one, not even a Iop is dumb enough for that! No, I was only picking up the dead wood that the Forest was leaving for me. I was a kind of Forest guardian, in the end.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Anyway, this is all to say that in my line of work, I've seen and heard all sorts of weird things in this wood. But I never thought I'd witness a fight between two Protectors of the months!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All this started on a day in Descendre, just before the Ice Age. I was going on my usual round, and had gathered quite a lot of dead branches, when I head an infernal racket coming from the depths of the forest. It sounded like nothing I knew of. Like giant Cracklers having a jumping contest on the mossy forest floor.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I'm a naturally curious man. And I don't flee in the face of the unknown. I'd rather just head straight on. It's often worked against me... But sometimes, it pays off. So I headed into the forest to make some sense of it all.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>As I moved forward, the sounds were getting louder and I could hear the ground vibrating. I'll admit, I was a bit scared, but I wanted to see what was happening.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's when I saw her, coming around a copse. She was beautiful and blue, unreal, captivating. She was as tall as a Trool, as light as a Tofu feather, as gracious as a Bulbush. A frozen beauty. For a second, I though she was the snow queen from my childhood tales. But no, she wasn't a queen! Or a goddess! Or even a mirage! She was Jiva, Guardian of the Month of Javian!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It didn't take me long to realise she wasn't alone. Across from her stood a massive demon who was struggling to stay on his feet. It was Djaul, Descendre's protector... When I saw this colossus, straight out of the Tartar, I felt so small! For a second, I thought of leaving without making a sound, but I was too scared they would see me. So I stayed there, dead still. And I watched them fight.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Oh, but it was incredible! A battle of titans! Djaul threw himself at Jiva and pulled her hair. Jiva countered by kicking him violently in the elbows. So, he started slapping her! She flicked his nose! Bang! They both fell to the floor, taking the trees down with them!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>I had no idea how they were ever going to be stopped. It was like two Crackers fighting in a Tofu House. The blows rained down, fists destroying everything in their path, feathers flying... And everything around them was being pulverised. Luckily, I was far enough away to not get smashed to smithereens. Though there were a few times when I wondered how much longer I was going to last!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I'd been watching for quite a while when I saw Djaul hit Jiva below the belt. Scratch! A violent claw strike! In an instant, Jiva's leg was slashed. Then, blood began to pour from the wound, a deep blue blood that dripped down her leg. It sprayed the ground and was absorbed by the earth, so quickly that it was unreal. And after only a few seconds, the nearby vegetation started to change. I saw curious shiny, icy blue veins appear around stems and trunks. Petals were frozen, leaves were paralysed and barks were petrified, all at an incredible speed.</p>\n<p>Jiva's frozen blood had contaminated the entire forest.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>After seeing that, I packed up my courage and decided it was time to get out of there. Pronto! The Protectors resumed their fight, and I made the most of it! I was so panicked that it took me only a few minutes to reach my cabin and lock myself inside!</p>\n<p>That was a good move. As soon as I was sheltered, a horrific blizzard started raging outside. The Ice Age had begun.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Even today, I still thank the gods for sparing me. If I'd have stayed outside, I would have frozen to death for sure!</p>\n<p>As for the forest, it became covered by a thick layer of ice.

And I loved him madly. He made my heart beat as strong as a Dofus' pulse. But he was a cold and harsh man. He was obsessed by his research and spent most of his time in his workshop, carrying out experiments, I don't know what on. He never touched me, he would look me up and down with an icy stare, as if I were disturbing him every time I wanted some of his attention. Eventually, I came to my senses. I told myself he was married to his work, and that there wasn't any room for a woman in his heart of ice.</p> <br> <p></p> <br> <p>I was wrong...</p> <pagefeed/> <p>One night, when I went down to his workshop unexpectedly, I caught him with another woman. It was an Enutrof! And she was as bald as a coot! Judging from the Tormentator poking out of her sack, she must have been one of those slightly unstable people who occasionally put on the Dark Knight's costume. When I saw this bald woman, smiling, in her black tights and scruffy cape, with her arms around my husband, my heart stopped beating and my blood froze.</p> <br> <p></p> <br> <p>A deathly, devastating cold, which took hold of me and made me lose all sense and reason. Without thinking, I left my hiding place and invoked a hoard of Homing Hands which attacked the couple. Busy as they were, the two perpetrators didn't even see them coming and the hands ripped them to shreds. It was quick, violent and cold. Just like it always was with Victor.</p> <pagefeed/> <p>Initially exhausted by the pain of having been betrayed, I soon began to notice that I was actually feeling a strange sense of relief. As if I'd just been freed from a burden I'd been dragging around with me forever. So, I decided to wipe the slate clean and leave the place where I'd been blinded by love for far too long. As I was packing my bags, I came across some precious documents belonging to my late dear and tender husband. That's how I discovered the subject of his research, the thing which he had been so obsessed about all these years: the formula for a low temperature soaking liquid, destined for forging a revolutionary steel!</p> <br> <p></p> <br> <p>Armed with this precious discovery, I left and never looked back, deciding to rebuild my life from scratch and never show weakness again. Looking to make some profit from my ex-husband's formula, I set off for Pandala to meet Hotari Honza, the great master forger. I spent several months with him, as his disciple. I learnt to make formidable weapons according to ancient martial arts techniques.</p> <pagefeed/> <p>Together, we experimented with the properties of the soaking liquid and its astonishing ability to freeze steel in such a way it became stronger than diamond. Thanks to this research, I was able to forge a needle so strong and sharp that it would be able to cut the Xelor god himself down to size!</p> <br> <p></p> <br> <p>Alas, just as I was adding the final touches to my deadly weapon, Hotari Hanza accidentally slipped on a Larva Skin and spilled some of the precious liquid. It splashed in my face and my left eye frosted over. Blind in one eye, I decided it was time for me to move on once more and I hurriedly killed my great master.</p> <pagefeed/> <p>I learned, later on, that a noble stranger by the name of Harebourg was looking for innovative artisans for his project. I had nothing to lose and I needed a change of scene. It might have been my chance to finally become somebody!

Artisans and qualified labourers were rushing in from all over the island to join Count Harebourg's big project. Each one had been provided with their own house, as well as the tools necessary for them to be able to work under the best possible conditions. As for me, I'd been given a comfortable little chalet and a set of very high quality gears.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Count Harebourg financed the construction of the village and all its facilities. He made sure everything was perfect. He believed that ensuring his workers were comfortable would increase their productivity. But I think the real reason was that this great man was a philanthropist, and the well-being of those around him was fundamental in his eyes. Whatever it was, the artisans repaid him for his hospitality a hundred times over. You should have seen them at work on that building site! It was like a swarm of Moskitos on a Jullier night. They were buzzing about in all directions. For my part, I was feeling more motivated than ever. I had some experience in clock-making, but I'd never worked on anything this big before. It was very exciting!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The village was built at the foot of Mount Scauldron. In this respect, it was ideally located between the building site and the raw material supply points. Nothing had been left to chance and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on the success of the project. The count used to come down to supervise the construction himself. It was the same routine every day: he visited the workshops, gave his instructions and used the opportunity to warmly congratulate us. From the forger to the carpenter, to the clockwork installer, everyone was entitled to their own compliment and pat on the shoulder. It was always gratifying! We felt useful and appreciated. We got the feeling we were part of something extraordinary, something that was going to change the world!</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Alas! Frigost was the only thing that changed... and not in the way we hoped. When Descendre's cold hit the island, enormous quantities of snow accumulated on the slopes of Mount Scauldron, just above the village. They built up so quickly that it wasn't long before they threatened to come crashing down upon us.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Just a few minutes after the start of the Big Freeze, we heard a deafening and monstrous sound far away, a roar that sounded like it had escaped from the depths of the Tartar. It was like an earthquake, a typhoon on the sea, a big crash of thunder that would destroy everything... The tremor was so violent it upset the fragile balance that was the only thing protecting us from the inevitable: an avalanche.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>In an instant, a flood of frozen powder poured down on us, covering all that lay in its path. Instead of lava, the volcano seemed to be spewing out fountains of snow, which transformed into a relentless blizzard as they hurtled down the side of the mountain. In the blink of an eye, men were swept away, everything we owned was pulverised and our houses were blocked in by thick layers of ice.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The avalanche was brief. Violent. Merciless. And it had buried Boundwons Village forever.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>It takes time to recover from a tragedy like this. People had lost everything. It only took a couple of minutes to destroy our hopes, swept away by tonnes of snow. But the biting cold of Descendre forced us to into survival mode. We needed to react immediately if we didn't want to freeze to death.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The most cowardly among us ran away. They left the place that had welcomed them with open arms, and didn't look back. They preferred the warmth and comfort of the village to dealing with the consequences of their work. They were the ones who accused the count of being responsible for their unhappiness. The hypocrites!</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>The rest, on the other hand, set to work clearing the roofs of the houses and repairing what they could. They had been seriously shaken, but they remained loyal to the count. After all, Harebourg wasn't the only one responsible for what had happened. We'd all taken part in the project.

His obsession with Dofus was slowly eating away at his sanity. He needed all of them! Not just the six linked to the elements, but all the Dofus that the dragons had ever laid! Well, and because he wasn't really high-level enough to get the six.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the moment, he's only got one (Dofus, not level), but not just any one: the Ebony Dofus. He bought it from the market at Astrub for 10,000 kamas. What a stroke of luck! He couldn't help but laugh at the poor salesman who had no idea what this relic was worth.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It looked like fate had finally smiled down on him for the first time: in a few minutes he would also be in possession of the precious Ice Dofus. He reminded himself of the Enutrof's words. \"It's like I was telling you! A big egg, all cold at the end of the corridor, and beating like... like a Gobball's heart freshly pulled from its body. You mustn't leave that there, it's going to bring bad luck to the mine, a thing like that! As you're interested, I could tell you where it is, in exchange for a few kamas. That suits you and we get rid of it. Everyone's a winner.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kay Vine was just a few feet away from the place the mad old fool had told him about.

The frozen fruit of Aguabrial's entrails was there, within his grasp, and just one hideous eight-legged, four-headed, two-tentacled monster was there to defend it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When he swaggered out of the mine, Kay Vine was another Iop altogether. You could tell from two hundred kametres away that he was the new boss of Astrub, the one who managed to collect not one, but two Dofus... Proud of his exploits, he strutted up and down the city streets for hours, and the more he strutted, the more people paid attention to him. The men frowned when they saw him, the women burst out laughing behind their hands. They were finally admiring Kay Vine for what he was! At least, that's what he thought, but they were really looking at the brown, wet stain that could be seen growing on his trousers.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It was only in touching his pocket to make sure his treasures were still there that Kay Vine realised the extent of his Iopery. The so-called Ice Dofus had melted like snow in the sun. In fact, it had been sculpted from snow, and it had been unusually warm for Aperirel. The unfortunate consequence of this being that the Boo mud from which the Ebony Dofus was made had also started to soften when it came into contact with the water. There was not a trace left of either of the two eggs, just a puddle.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>For his part, the Enutrof thought he'd had a very good week indeed.

Everything is Wakfu; everything returns to Wakfu, in an eternal, unbreakable cycle.</p>\n<br> <p>Or does it? We have long believed that nothing can get in the way of the cycle of life, but numerous researchers have proven that it is possible to solidify Wakfu, as crystals or even as chewing gum. It seems absurd to say that something so free-flowing can be made to stop, but the proof is undeniable: some rocks and other surfaces with absorbent properties are capable of retaining a flow of Wakfu.</p>\n<br> <p>It is claimed that this retention can have dire consequences on the immediate environment, commonly known as Stasis. Yes, Stasis, the mysterious energy that some people believe is the evil opposite of Wakfu, is not a different energy at all, but rather a state of Wakfu itself: arrested Wakfu.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Without going into detail, since the inventory of formed crystals still needs to be done, what we know by the name of Stasis is made up of radiation emitted by arrested Wakfu.</p>\n<br> <p>Let's try, for a moment, to imagine Wakfu as a liquid made up of small, smiling blue circles. My hand is the receptacle, and the property of my hand is its ability to close and catch the fluid. Once it's trapped in my hand, a portion of the Wakfu cannot flow anymore.

When it's bright red, it's very, very angry.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Angry Wakfu emits radiation, red radiation that slowly \"contaminates\" the receptacle's surroundings. But contamination isn't really the right word, because this radiation, which we have named Stasis, feeds off Wakfu by eating any that is available and converting it into Stasis.</p>\n<br> <p>So, what happens if I open my hand? If I do it quickly, before the radiation becomes too powerful, the Wakfu becomes round again, and happily returns to its dance. If I wait too long, the charge from the build-up of hatred will create a Stasis explosion the minute I open my hand – a deflagration – then the Wakfu will, once again, become Wakfu.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The question is this: if Wakfu is everywhere, and if only a small amount of Stasis radiation is capable of exponentially eating the Wakfu, why hasn't all the Wakfu already been assimilated, since quite a large amount of Stasis has already been produced?</p>\n<br> <p>The first experiments carried out by Otomai's disciples concluded that, once its source has been removed, Stasis has an expiration date. So, if my fist remains closed, the radiation emitted will continue to spread, but, if I open my fist, eventually the time will come when this Stasis runs out of energy, loses its density and, eventually, ceases to exist.</p>\n<br> <p>Far from being purely lethal, Stasis radiation can be harnessed and used to run generators and machines, or can even be used to cure certain ailments. But in too great a quantity, Stasis can be destructive. Just like Wakfu, uncontrolled, destroying everything in its path. Neither Good nor Evil, ultimately. Everything in moderation, therefore, is the key to equilibrium.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Thanks to the excavation of Astrub's foundations, the remains of Vili Valley, the home of the first Eliatrope colony, have been discovered. Our archaeologists have found what's left behind of a vast initiation ground, a giant playing field where young Eliatropes would have learned the ritual acts that would mark their passage into adulthood. These acts, these Mysteries, involve a meticulous imitation of the initial reaction of the prophet Chibi when he first discovered the existence of the reality of Wakfu.</p>\n<br> <p>The reality of Wakfu. These words ring like a death sentence to our ears, accustomed only to hearing the rational. But the Eliatropes lived their lives by way of Mysteries, and these days, we know next to nothing about these delicate, myriad prophecies. The very taste of the unknown has deserted our desensitised palates.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Mystery. The word seems to come from far away, at least as far as the horizon. You'll never catch it; it's a gap, a line of demarcation between mankind and the invisible kingdom. A mystery that, if we stick to our modern definitions, is a secret, enveloped in an enigma, played out in a game of charades.</p>\n<br> <p>But for our ancestors, a Mystery was a ritual, an instant passage to a revelation that, confronted with the abstraction of a deity, gave the individual the strength to brave the shadows. The mystic had to remove the veils of a mortal existence from their eyes to contemplate the movement of a free soul. The veils were the successive complexities of the Goddess, the intimate Mystery of her presence in the world. In order to reveal it, the Mystic had to learn to see.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The tablets of glyphs tell us there are three veils. Three layers of understanding to shed like the used skins of a truth, worn out by the successive interpretations of a people in peril. Faced with the Void, a young Eliatrope had to learn to look between the threads to discover, tentatively, the Great Goddess's body. Her hands, her face, her hair. Each veil more difficult than the last to remove, requiring discipline and concentration.</p>\n<br> <p>To see the Goddess, Chibi crossed Vili on foot, like a tightrope walker, and it was these steps, these tense hands, that the Eliatropes must faithfully recreate. Conditioned by weeks of training, by rigorous fasting, their bodies learned to produce a meaning, timelessness, a divine out-of-worldliness, before once again being able to step out into the daylight.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"The universe is an egg, created by the Great Dragon to prove his love to the Goddess. At the centre of the egg is the source of all life, the egg blue, an ocean of Wakfu swept by winds of change. Somewhere in this ocean journeys a whale, the Wakfu whale, a huge blue leviathan. When it exhales, the whale ejects a violent jet of Wakfu filled with fragments of worlds. We gave a name to these fragments: we call them the islands. Legend has it that by climbing to the very top of these islands, you can reach the egg blue, a vast tornado where it is said you can reach other universes, other timelines, or even discover the secret room where the Goddess comes to rest from her dance with the Great Dragon.\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The myths are not literal truths, even if they sometimes surprise us with their extreme details. Before the poets assembled them as one, disregarding certain paradoxes, the myths were the fragments of a continuous story, a maze of possibilities, where everything existed along with its opposite.</p>\n<br> <p>The Zinit petroglyphs are our main reference to the world before the time of gods. This patchwork allows us to weave a more ambitious and vast cultural context so we may place the Eliatrope civilisation in the evolution of the World of Twelve, and in the cosmos. We now know that the Eliatropes thought of the afterlife as an eternity spent alongside the Goddess. This eternity would take place in the contemplation of an amazing world that was constantly being renewed.</p>","contentCSS":"null"},"193":{"id":193,"typeId":2,"titleId":"The client

first arrived in Frigost. At that time, I was still a novice shoemaker, but I already had a few avant-garde ideas. I had, for example, created a pair of boots filled with holes, to limit how much a Sadida's feet would sweat. My slogan was simple: \"Detox, the boot that breathes\".</p>\n<br> <p>As a master shoemaker, Emilk was instantly interested in my work... and in me! We hit it off straight away and, as he'd only just arrived on the island and hadn't found anywhere to stay yet, I invited him to stay at my house that night. The night turned into weeks, weeks into months and then, one day, we got married. I'd finally found the shoe that fit!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>I didn't really know anything about him, but it didn't matter. Our days were full of happiness and new experiences. We exchanged belts, and worked on our respective leathers; we offered each other our feet to try out our creations...</p>\n<br> <p>Occasionally, when he had too much to do, I would lovingly polish his magnificent purses before displaying them proudly in the window. Our little business was flourishing and it didn't take long for word of our work to go beyond the borders of Frigost...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>One night, when Emilk was out getting us a new supply of Gobbly leather, a stranger came into the shop. His face was covered by a large hood and he spoke with a heavy Amaknian accent. He perused our different articles and seemed particularly interested in the boots made by my husband. He asked me some questions about Emilk, his work, and his past...</p>\n<br> <p>I thought it was odd, but I had nothing to hide. After a few minutes, my husband came back with his arms full of freshly tanned hides. As soon as he saw the stranger, he froze, rooted to the spot, and dropped his load. The two men stared at each other for a moment, and then they threw themselves at each other with enormous violence. It was mad! I'd never seen anyone fight like that before. The kicks were flying in all directions; they were constantly tripping one another up and stepping on one another's heels. Anyone would have thought it was a type of dance where the aim was to turn the partner around to give them a kick up the bum.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>All of a sudden, the stranger carried out a formidable piqué arabesque, knocking Emilk to the ground. But while he was preparing to deal my husband a fatal blow, the latter got out his secret boot. It's a leather boot with a lead heel that he always keeps up his sleeve. He was back on his feet in a flash and hit the stranger over the head with his deadly weapon. Too horrified to think or protest, I helped him to throw the body out to sea. But it didn't take me long to come back to my senses! Who was this stranger we'd just turned into Snapper food? And what did he want from us? What horrible nightmare had Emilk got himself embroiled in? Who was the man I'd married?</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"I'm not who you think I am,\" he told me. \"My real name is Klime. And the man you saw... the man I killed... was Arthur Luthuthu. We both belonged to a brotherhood of shoemakers. A discreet brotherhood, specialised in martial arts and saving the world.</p>\n<br> <p>\"But maybe we should start at the very beginning: Our Grand Master, Hogmeiser, founded the Order of the Kicked Ass about ten years ago. He was the one who recruited us: Arthur Luthuthu, Bowisse and myself. At the beginning, there were four of us, just like the sacred Elements. That wasn't an accident: we had actually set ourselves the objective of studying the properties of the Quadramental Breeze. We were carrying out loads of experiments on leathers and hides, in order to sublimate the virtues and create very powerful magical objects. We were all very gifted, but I was, without any doubt, the best of the four! So, of course, the others became jealous of my talent...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>One day, I managed to create a pair of super-powerful boots, brimming with elemental magic. It was the culmination of all my work. I was so proud that I felt I ought to make more pairs and put them up for sale. But when the members of the Order learned of it, they were very quick to protest. They said these boots were too powerful to be distributed to mere mortals. That if they got into the wrong hands, they could be very dangerous! Pff! Bunkum! They were just jealous, that's all! They couldn't fool me!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>When they started talking about getting back the boots I'd already sold, I wanted to stop them! They wanted to destroy them and replace them with inoffensive copies! I couldn't be having that! It was my work! The greatest success of my career! And I wanted the whole world to know what an exceptional craftsman I was! Seeing that I was going to ruin his plans, Hogmeiser decided he was going to take preventative measures. He ordered them to lock me in the basement of our workshop to shut me up. While I was locked up, the members of the Order could quietly steal the boots I'd sold and replace them.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>I later learned they'd completely disassociated me from the Order and had erased all trace of my membership. They told anyone that would listen that the boots were faulty and it was the fault of a shoemaker called L. Lee Vatorchains, or something like that. Even worse, they had even gone as far as staging my death, in case anyone ever asked what had become of me. As if they hadn't already humiliated me enough, they made up some grotesque story about an accident with a Jelly. Well, the Order always had been the masters of obfuscation. I've lost count of the number of times we lied about our dates of birth or our identities!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>But I wasn't going to let them bury me that easily! I'd kept a pair of boots, which I'd hidden not far from the shoemakers' shop. All I had to do was find a way to free myself and get them. Luckily, Bowisse, who had tied me up, hadn't thought to look under my belt. That was where I kept my tools. My leather cutter! I managed to cut myself free and get out of there. I found my precious boots right where I'd left them and I decided to lie low for a while. But I hadn't forgotten that Hogmeiser and I had some business to settle! He'd locked me up! He'd let people think I was dead! He'd taken away my life! And now it was my turn to take his!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>One day, I followed one of his hunting parties. He quite often went Gobball hunting to restock his leather supply. I waited until he had his back turned, busy cleaning some slobber off his shoe, and bam! With one blow of my boot to his elbow, he was eliminated! So as not to arouse suspicion, I dragged his body to the centre of the ruminants and let the War Chiefs do the rest. It was an almost perfect crime! Now I'd gotten my revenge, there was nothing to keep me in Amakna anymore. I decided to head off to a faraway country, where the remaining members of the Order wouldn't think to look for me: Frigost. That's when I met you. You already know the rest. Bowisse must be in charge now instead of Hogmeiser, and he obviously sent Arthur to look for me. But any threat has been thwarted, for now...\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>When Emilk... erm Klime, I mean, finished his story, I was completely gobsmacked. The person I'd loved and cherished was a traitor. A murderer. A fugitive! And all I wanted was a quiet, uncomplicated life! I couldn't bring myself to stay with this monster! I remained impassive. I pretended that I understood, and that I supported him. But inside, I was horrified. I waited until he was asleep, then I grabbed one of his purses and quickly packed my bags. I fled. For a little while, I hid at my aunt's house and, once I'd cried every tear in my body, I decided to leave Frigost.</p>\n<br> <p>At the time of writing, I am getting ready to board a ship to Amakna. I haven't seen Klime since that fateful night, a few weeks ago. The last I heard of him, he'd been approached by Count Harebourg, the nobleman who lives at the top of Mount Scauldron. Apparently, he's been recruited to work on a special project. I don't know any more than that. And I don't want to.</p>\n<br> <p>I'm leaving Frigost, and it's the right thing to do.</p>","contentCSS":"null"},"205":{"id":205,"typeId":1,"titleId":"In Search of Immortality","authorId":"Nileza","subTitleId":"Volume 1","contentId":"<p><u>25th Maysial 549</u></p>\n<br> <p>I have just discovered a very fascinating treatise!

He did deserve a rest, after all. So, he took the cannon to Moon Island and poof! In a flash of lightning, he found himself on a sandy beach, sipping Kokoko milk.</p>\n<p>But this break didn't last for very long. A new threat was on its way to cause trouble in the relative calm of the World of Eleven. A mysterious serial thief was spreading panic in the Imp Village. And, according to the King's spies, they were now heading straight for Amakna!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Faster than the wind, more tanned than a Cawwot fried in palm oil, Captain Amakna set off back to his proud country and started to investigate. He headed for the Cania Plains straight away and climbed to the top of one of the centenarian trees to reach the Imp's fortified castle. What he saw there left him speechless: someone had horribly mutilated the village's Mace and Rickshaw Robots! They had removed all their limbs and had even taken away their parts, and they'd even stolen their joints! It was unacceptable! The imps were unrivalled builders and these wooden machines were once their pride and joy, as well as their main defence weapons. The Captain couldn't let this horrible crime go unpunished! But how could he find the culprit? He didn't seem to have left a single clue behind! That's when our defender of justice noticed an inscription on one of the village platforms. Someone had written a message there, in elbow grease: \"Save the dear breeder, save the world...- Sylargh\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>All this was very mysterious indeed. Captain Amakna didn't really understand what Sylargh meant by that. What was the point of stripping down all those Imp Robots? And who was this \"dear breeder\" that had to be saved? Was the world in that much danger? Armed with his legendary intuition, Captain Amakna decided to continue his investigation in Astrub. The rumours were flying in the City of Mercenaries, and he was sure he'd find what he was looking for there. He also hoped to find out more about this famous breeder from the message. They're talking about a mysterious breeder, recently arrived in the town, and already known for their exorbitant prices. If the Captain was looking for a very \"dear\" breeder, that was probably the one he was looking for! It was said he kept a farm near the Amakna mines. But, of course, no one could say anything for sure.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Not that it matters! These small snippets of information were more than enough for our glorious Captain! Without a moment's thought, he headed straight for the mine in question in the hope of shedding some light on the mystery. Alas! He'd realised his error as soon as he'd entered the mine: He played right into the paws of the Boowolf. In less time than it takes for an Enutrof to grab a coin that's fallen on the floor, Sylargh had thrown himself on him and knocked him out. When he came back to his senses, the Captain was tied to an abandoned chariot, deep inside the mine. He squinted in the dark and could make out bits of wood and metal stacked up around him. They were the parts stolen from the Imp Robots! He had been brought here... but why? Our valiant hero hardly had time to think about it. Sylargh was coming towards him, snickering, half hidden by the dark. His eyes were shining with hatred, he was smiling evilly and he was the same height as a Xelor dwarf... because he was an Imp! Oh, yes! A measly, little Imp! The Captain couldn't believe his eyes. This vulgar shrimp, no bigger than a baby Tofu, had managed to put him out of harm's way!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Mwa ha ha ha!\", laughed Sylargh with a voice from beyond the grave. \"So, here's the famous Captain Amakna, trapped in an abandoned mine! It's funny, don't you think? The call of the poor breeder in distress, the world to save, all that... you couldn't resist, could you? Haha!\" Heroes these days are so predictable! It's almost becoming tiresome. I knew you wouldn't think twice about rushing into these tunnels. You see, I know how these things work! It's a sort of gift! I'm a very special person! Just like you... But you must be wondering why I wanted you here! Well, I'm going to tell you! I know from experience that the best evil geniuses shouldn't unveil their plans before they carry them out, but I like to boast about my exploits! So, here's my story:</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>I'm one of the best builders in my village. THE best, some say. And they're right. No need for false modesty, is there? I am the most gifted, that's indisputable! Well, not so long ago I drew some plans for a new prototype of the Mace Robot. It was a real marvel! The problem was that I didn't have enough materials to build it. I could have asked my Imp brothers to help me find some, but I don't like begging. So, I helped myself! The scraps you see around you are the ones I stole from my village's Robots. But I'm sure you'd already figured that out... What you don't know, though, is that to finish my invention, I need a metal that is both very light and extremely resistant. I've tried all the known minerals in Amakna, but none of them have worked. I need something else. Something like your famous shield, for example! Mwa ha ha! It's said it's been forged out of a rare and precious metal. That's true, isn't it? Hmm... I see I wasn't wrong about you! What would you say to me taking it off your hands and melting it down to forge the pieces I need? It could be fun, no?\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>At these words, Captain Amakna felt fear for the first time in his incredible life. The idea that his magnificent shield might be taken away terrorised him. If such a dreadful thing were to happen, he might never get over it. He couldn't let that happen! So, listening just to his courage, the Captain decided to act... and reveal his secret! His shield was unique, of course. But the metal it was made of wasn't that rare. It was only unknown in Amakna. The Captain had had it secretly imported from far away Frigost, so he could keep his monopoly on ultra-powerful shields. Apparently, the Frigostians had a little island with rich mineral resources. That was where the famous mineral his shield had been forged with came from. But that was all he knew about it. All he could say was that his shield was nothing compared to the vast quantity of minerals Sylargh would find on Frigost. There was no point in destroying it!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Upon hearing this, Sylargh seemed to hesitate. He didn't know whether or not to believe the Captain. He thought about it, and then approached our hero, menacingly. He seized the shield, held it in the air, above the forge he'd just built and... He suddenly turned around and hit the Captain over the head with it. Knocked out once more, our hero sunk into the meanderings of his unconscious.</p>\n<p>When he came round again, our illustrious Captain was alone in the mine. Sylargh had disappeared, leaving the hero's shield at his feet. No one knew where he'd gone, but he was never again heard of in Amakna. It's said that a Pandawa saw him getting on a ship headed for Frigost. But, as everyone knows, Pandawa hallucinations are very common. And it's very rare one of their accounts forms the basis of an investigation. Whatever happened, Captain Amakna had other fish to fry. The King's militia had just announced the escape of Pink Skull, his old enemy...</p>","contentCSS":".document_content2_es-class7 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nli {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class6 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class5 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n"},"207":{"id":207,"typeId":2,"titleId":"The artists.","authorId":"","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p><img height=\"290\"  hspace=\"0\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" src=\"##swf,778##\"></p>\n<p>Marie Fromont</p>\n<br> <p>Claire Larras</p>\n<br> <p>Nicolas \"I-ko\" Posadas</p>\n<br> <p>Etienne \"Blacklilipute\" Corbaux</p>\n<br> <p>Mélanie \"Meli\" Christin</p>\n<br> <p>Julien \"Rumo\" Druand</p>\n<br> <p>Faysal \"Biochieur\" Boukari</p>\n<br> <p>Emilie \"Doki\" Leborgne</p>","contentCSS":"null"},"208":{"id":208,"typeId":2,"titleId":"The translators.","authorId":"","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p><img height=\"290\"  hspace=\"0\" width=\"200\" align=\"right\" src=\"##swf,80##\"> Gloria Morano</p>\n<br> <p>Silvia \"LucyVanPelt\"</p>\n<br> <p>Julia A.

To be honest, when Srams first find out about it, they go white with fear too, but since they have such a pale complexion, no one notices. The neophyte's aim is to become extremely supple and to control his senses and his Chakras perfectly. Believe me, it can be really useful! Mastering this art will enable him to dislocate a joint so as to voluntarily sneak into very narrow places. Srams are not afraid of tight spaces... as long as there are kamas hidden inside.

A young Cra can shoot down a Moskito with spit weighed down by sugary sweets. The meetings behind the public urinal at the Trool Fair made Cras famous (because their jets are very long, if not the longest). Cra archers can carve a projectile out of just about any material, including the rarest ones, just by following their instinct. For instance, a Treechnid branch, once carved, can be of a surprising long range. Cras' craftsmanship became renowned thanks to their bow jobs, in which they take both pride and pleasure.</p><pagefeed/><p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Show me your arrow and I'll tell you who you are</span></p><p></p><p>Hair blowing in the wind, slender silhouette, chiselled muscle structure, chest thrown out: the Cra disciple is proud, that's for sure.

That's why they're so popular for hunting and combat groups, in which they are known to have saved many allies. Of course, when Cras are forced to enter close combat, they find it harder to stand their ground... but you can't have it all!</p><pagefeed/><p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>The Worship of Cra</b></span></p><p></p><p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>The Goddess Cra</span></p><p></p><p>Her beauty is as fearsome as her arrows... apparently, only her disciples can look at her without falling head over heels in love!

Their reason for creating such a language remains unknown, but some say that Enutrofs can use it to communicate without any of the creatures wandering about the Abyss realising it. Others believe that Enutrofs combine geometrical figures drawn with their fingers to encrypt access to their treasures. Others prefer to think that it's a ritual way of shielding the nose from the after-effects of the sickening explosions of underground gases (the notorious firedamp farts that have left many an adventurer unconscious).

Besides that, the first thing Enutrofs do when they meet other adventurers is to get their measure with a single look. It's true. In the eyes of an Enutrof, an adventurer is a rich source of goods, often bedecked in items. Enutrofs also talk a lot: often all sorts of nonsense about this and that, but also about things they're interested in, like the price of Gobball wool in Astrub, or if it's possible to find Treechnid Amber at a good price near Bonta, those sorts of things... If adventurers listen carefully, they may well be able to get their hands on knick-knacks and charms... for a small fee, of course.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>The Worship of Enutrof</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>The God Enutrof</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A huge, divine dragon, his body is a mixture of molten magma and melted gold, and he can change anything he wants into shiny gold.

They even added a section dedicated to the knowledge of underground worlds. Naturally drawn to deep caverns, Enutrofs started to criss-cross the bowels of the World: zigzagging in between lumps of earth and blocks of clay, cutting a path through masses of shale and manganese, dissecting mineral blocks – it was such a huge job that we ought to be thankful to the Enutrofs, as nobody else would have done it. These cavern-dwellers learned all there was to know about stones and gems – to their great advantage, obviously – not least because very often the carcasses of creatures dead for many years were well preserved, with all their treasures intact.

For some people, the heart symbolises love, friendship and little girls running through sunny, flowery meadows, but not for Iop and his disciples; this vital organ only interests them when they can rip it out of their enemies chests, still beating!

Indeed, research in the archives of Amakna would suggest that this edifice was built by a number of courageous followers. I can picture those proud builders: sweating, with aching muscles, harassed by Moskitos, running the risk of slipping on greasy Larvae and smashing their faces off the ground, stinking of Arachnee, and fighting the surrounding vermin every inch of the way, just to be able to celebrate the glory of Iop at the end of it. You know you're a Iop when you'll go through that just to hear divine words of wisdom such as \"Fighting feels great, doesn't it?\" or \"A fist-fight a day keep the sadness at bay.\" You really do need to be a Iop to appreciate the finer points of such philosophy.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>Typical Expressions – How to Speak Iop</b></span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Iops don't have a huge vocabulary, but there are still a few colourful expressions around.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>To have blood on one's hands:</span> not necessarily a good thing for a normal person, this is a sign that a Iop has had a good day.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Get an eyeful of metal:</span> when an enemy surrenders too rapidly, without fighting enough in the Iop's opinion, a blade is placed under the enemy's nose – or in their eye.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>That wouldn't break three legs on a Tofu:</span> used to signify that something is disappointing: \"Hunting Arachnees wouldn't break three legs on a Tofu.\"</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>You're in agony... so what?:</span> reply to be addressed to an opponent begging for mercy.</p>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>I could taste the blood:</span> an expression of impatience.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>One-hit wonder</span>: an enemy who dies after one attack.

Their god doesn't take offence at this since he likes them too! As a matter of fact, his followers' most powerful summons is a Wyrmling.

Fights started, Tofus and Gobballs were summoned, and the chaos spread right to the temple. Soon, the statues were spattered with Tofu blood. You can still see traces of the race in the Ingalsses' Fields: two circles linked by a straight line... Tourists tend to think the symbol has something to do with aliens...

Meeting a Sacrier in the moonlight is an especially nerve-racking experience: his proud, muscular, sinewy silhouette, his forearms covered in a thick layer of blood, his glassy eyes gazing into yours... in short, you'd be better off on his side than against him! Fortunately for them, Sacriers have a great sense of humour. Grinning from ear to ear, a Sacri will never tire of asking you to hit him (\"Go on! As hard as you can!\") and is one of the rare examples of adventurers who will play the \"Stop hitting yourself!\" game all alone. In company, he'll delight everyone with his jokes about massacre and bloodshed, and his favourite party trick is juggling his enemies' organs. In short, he's a great guy to have around, and the perfect warrior companion!</p><pagefeed/><p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>It's incredible how much you can do with meat</span></p><p></p><p>Curious by nature, Sacriers are fascinated by anatomy.

Sacriers are renowned for being caught poking and prodding at things and generally putting their fingers everywhere, to the delight of some men and the terror of more women. Though their habits might seem confusing, they're very useful for the magic they practise!</p><p>They are naturally good butchers, since they have a passion for chopping meat, and gutting carcasses with their bare hands. If they embrace their spiritual path, they can become very clever soothsayers. As they do not fear blows or injuries, they are great on the front line and are very much appreciated by groups of adventurers.</p><pagefeed/><p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>The Worship of Sacrier</b></span></p><p></p><p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>The Goddess Sacrier</span></p><p></p><p>One of the last to enter the Pantheon of gods, this beautiful, rebellious and opportunist goddess endures suffering with serenity.

In the mean time, we'll just have to suppose that they have a good reason for going to such efforts to hide their hideout. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the goddess Sacrier's arrival in our World aroused Rushu's anger... in the list of things a place of worship should be protected from, a demon's vengeful anger must be fairly high...</p><pagefeed/><p><span class='document_content2_fr-class5'><b>Typical expressions - How to speak Sacrier</b></span></p><p></p><p>The word \"blood\" obviously features quite often in Sacrier discourse... not in every expression, but in most of them, to be honest.

If a Sadida needs to pick up a plant or cut down a tree, he will always ask its permission, as a Sadida is in perfect harmony with Nature.

One day, pondering on how to go about making people adore her, she found the remains of a Blop that had died from a squirt of Sporm. The whole thing was almost liquid and a cloud of Crows were stumbling around it. To her great surprise, the black feathered creatures were all drunk, staggering and unable to fly. This was an epiphany, and her powers started to grow as she experimented in the art of fermentation. She tried it on everything: plants and creatures, organs and peels, they all became liquids with unique flavours, and anyone who drank them would find themselves in a trance, leaving the goddess free to wrap them around her little finger! Soon everyone around was drunk and convinced that the goddess Pandawa was fabulous!

In fact, they only worshipped Raval, the founder of their clan, which they dedicated to him. But no matter how much the Rogues kept their work hidden in the shadows, there was one god who, as usual, didn't miss a trick: Sram. Nobody knows exactly how this god ousted the protector of Septangel, but somehow he managed to steal the Rogue disciples for himself. He named himself the Rogues' only god, using the pseudonym Eugor, and convinced everyone that Raval was a mere representative. Little by little, less and less was heard of Raval, until eventually the Rogues started to believe in Eugor. Finally, at the height of his glory, Eugor revealed who he really was. You have to admit that tricking not one but thousands of Rogues is no mean feat!

It destroyed everything, killing, burning and snarling... until the day that Sadida decided to step in.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Discovering that the little brat was invincible, he decided to split its soul and seal the different parts into masks, which in turn were hidden deep inside a cave guarded by a YeCh'ti... that'd teach him! The plan worked perfectly... until a sneaky blacksmith came to distract the guard... and since then, the masks have been scattered all around the World.</p>\n<p>These days, people say that the Masqueraiders have become the guardians of the ancient power, on Sadida's behalf.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><span class='document_content2_fr-class6'>The Masqueraider Refuge</span></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Masqueraiders surfaced in a lost village deep in the mountains. People say that before this time, the area had been home only to a blacksmith and his family. Karai, for that was his name, had been more or less rejected by his peers and worked day and night on a secret project. But what could a blacksmith be up to that was so secret? Could he have been the very first Masqueraider? Even today, nobody knows for sure...</p>\n<p>Over the years, the mask-wearing community grew and grew, until it extended right up to and over Crackler Mountain. It was in this region's terrain that the Masqueraiders took refuge. Right up at the top, a carvers' workshop can be found. Perhaps Karai built it...

Could it have been down to Naz T Peasawerk, the demon perched on a branch just above him? Almost certainly!</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>In this dream, Jeff was being celebrated as a hero by a delirious crowd. Finally, people were recognising all his hard work!</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>When the inventor was on the verge of awakening from his dream, Naz T Peasawerk slipped down from his branch and whispered in his ear: \"All of that can become reality... All you need to do is take my advice...\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Stunned by the dream and the promise it seemed to hold, Jeff took the demon up on his offer.</p>\n<br> <p>He got down to work. His first creation was a device which could tell whether the cawwots were cooked. It proved to be an unprecedented success!</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>The demons promises came true. Jeff, the hitherto unknown inventor, soon became a genius admired far and wide.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>The Gods' Unease</b></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>But I know what you're going to say: but Herdegrize, what did the twelve Gods think of all this?</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Realising that Jeff Stobbs's cult was taking on considerable proportions, the gods became scared that he would somehow reach their pantheon. The arrival of a new god didn't pose a problem in itself, but the presence of a demon at his side would be a decidedly bad omen. So they decided to take action.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>Not wanting to intervene directly, the gods hatched a plan.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Each one designated a faithful follower to be named Hero. Knowing that these representatives would not be enough to stop the inventor and his demon, they united their powers to create a being in the form of a dragon, which they named Animakhal. They gave him an extraordinary power: he could create clones in the image of the Heroes. In this way, he would be able to build an army strong enough to stop Jeff Stobbs and Naz T Peasawerk.</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p>The future of the World of Twelve was now in the hands of these worthy Heroes...</p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p></p>\n<br> <p><i>...and in your hands too, sublime readers! Do you want to know the rest of this heart-stopping story? Do you too want to fight epic battles alongside Animakhal? Then don't delay! As soon as you can, procure the full version of my book!

Certain Dracologists vehemently reject this belief, arguing that these two creatures have very little in common with beings such as Grougalorasalar or Terrakourial, and even less with Osamodas' divine dragons.</p>\n<p>Perhaps various types of dragon exist? Personally, for the time being, I have remained neutral regarding this debate.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Appearances in Amakna</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All the recounts have Grozilla and Grasmera down as guardians of the Dreggon Sanctuary. The two monsters supposedly slept underground for centuries, only very occasionally waking.</p>\n<p>The first time they awoke, it led to the destruction of the original Amakna village.</p>\n<p>Some adventurers claim to have encountered the two guardians many years later, in 637, when exploring the sanctuary's depths.</p>\n<p>The second verified appearance arrived in 639. Following the destruction of the Sauroshells which had appeared in great number on Dreggon Peninsula, Grozilla and Grasmera came out into the open. There followed epic confrontations in which the titans took on huge groups of heroes from all walks of life. At last, after much bloodshed, Grozilla and Grasmera left the area.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>The Invasion of Kwismas Island</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>People thought that the two dragons had retired to the underground areas of the Dreggon Sanctuary, but they were wrong: the pair had set off to explore new horizons.</p>\n<p>Taking the last Sauroshells with them, Grozilla and Grasmera swam until they reached Kwismas Island. They stayed there for some time, wreaking havoc which cannot be described in words.</p>\n<p>According to accounts, this finished in a cataclysm: apparently, the Sauroshells, which the monsters had placed safely in a cavern, reached maturity and exploded with such incredible force that a piece of the island itself was sent flying up into the air!</p>\n<p>Following this event, Grozilla and Grasmera disappeared once again... until now.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Discovery at the Centre of the Earth</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It was only when the McGraff-Hartvigg expedition set about exploring the underground depths of the Pinki Crater at the heart of the Vulkanian archipelago that the next chapter was opened. Rummaging through the caverns, the team made an extraordinary, astonishing discovery: Grozilla and Grasmera, asleep in the middle of a load of Sauroshells!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As part of the expedition group, I was present when this unexpected discovery was made. It was a historic moment.

I could hear countless eggs knocking against one another and whispering in the gloom. I could feel the noxious breath of Crocabulia's descendants on my skin. I could make out the scaly bodies of Dragostesses moving behind the screens of steam.</p>\n<p>I might have believed that these were merely due to my imagination. But deep down inside, I knew that it was more than that. I thought that they were messages sent by the god Osamodas, to warn us of what was going to happen...</p>\n<p>The events which followed eventually proved me right. The dreams were premonitions.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>The Coming of the Lords of Vulkania</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>How did Grozilla and Grasmera get to Vulkania?</p>\n<p>Basing my reflections on my knowledge as well as the dreams I had been having, I tried to imagine what might have happened.</p>\n<p>After the explosion on Kwismas Island, Grozilla and Grasmera felt a deep bitterness. They had wanted to protect the Sauroshells, and in fact they had condemned them to death! These eggs had been very valuable to them, because the Sauroshells had been laid by the Sanctuary's Dragostesses in their honour.</p>\n<p>From his celestial throne, the god Osamodas took pity on the two overwhelmed monsters. He blew an inspiring image into their scaly noggins: a volcanic island, a paradise on earth far from any ship's regular route. Grozilla and Grasmera swam to the island in question. There, deep inside the volcano, they found something they never could have imagined: five Dragostesses waiting for them.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Beyond the Veil of Sleep</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>That's how the new Sauroshells were conceived – a new Vulkanian variety. After an idyllic existence which lasted for some time, Grozilla and Grasmera started to feel weary... the Dragostesses and their offspring were growing more numerous every day, and requiring more and more energy. They decided to take a nap.</p>\n<p>And it was this restful sleep that the pair were enjoying when the expedition team stumbled across them.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Many questions remain unanswered. For the moment, we have only found Sauroshells on the island. Where are the adult Vulkanian Dreggons hiding? What about Grozilla and Grasmera's partners, the Dragostesses? Despite long and arduous searches, we haven't managed to find them.</p>\n<p>I fully intend to solve the most recent mysteries in the Grozilla and Grasmera story, even if it means going down into the unfathomable, hitherto unexplored depths...</p>","contentCSS":".document_content2_es-class7 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nli {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\n.document_content2_es-class8 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class6 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"244":{"id":244,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Of Sauroshells and Dreggons","authorId":"Dina Tapio","subTitleId":"Theories on Vulkanian Wildlife","contentId":"<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Warning</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This book, written for amateur Dracologists, explains certain principles to do with Dreggon reproduction.

Only one or two islanders have spotted them. Their descriptions vary, so it may well be that several varieties exist. Perhaps one day, the Vulkanian Dreggons will come out into the sunlight... but perhaps it would be better if they didn't.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Madreggons</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This is a species of Vulkanian Dreggon that is a little less fierce than its cousins and that has already been captured and even domesticated. Treated as petsmounts, Madreggons are sterile, and all attempts to breed them have failed miserably.</p>\n<p>Even although Madreggons are less aggressive than their continental relatives, they still have an appetite just as healthy as that of any other Dreggon. Their favourite dish is elemental Sauroshells. Madreggons don't have much family loyalty...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>About the Horned God, Osamodas</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The episode during which Osamodas became enraged and punished the inhabitants of Amakna is widely known. What with Madreggons being domesticated now, do we need to fear the fury of the Master of Beasts once more? Or, on the contrary, should we see this event as a cautious start to forgiveness granted by the Celestial Tamer? Osamodas's ways are unfathomable... but just in case, it may be wise to make generous offerings to him, because you never know. There is an altar in Vulkania; do not hesitate to pray there fervently and to leave a contribution on your way out.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class6 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class6 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n"},"245":{"id":245,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Project Vulkania","authorId":"Suze McGraff","subTitleId":"Diary of an expedition","contentId":"<p>Well, this is it: we're setting off today!</p>\n<p>Almost all of the members of the expedition team are on board. The two Sacriers, Stok and Stak, are full of beans; they seem to be used to journeys like this. I had no idea they were cousins!</p>\n<p>Tristan Zubert, the wildlife specialist, is really nice. I can't say the same for Tom Stone. The guy seems kind of shady... he says he knows a lot about old stones, but it seems to me that he's really talking about the jewels he's hoping to get his mitts on.</p>\n<p>Ava is just excited as I am about our departure. If only her grandfather were here to see her now, I know how proud he'd be!</p>\n<p>Ivan Hartvigg was the last to arrive, as usual. Apparently, his lateness was down to the fact that he left his bag at the inn and had to go back for it.

We've found Vulkania!</p>\n<p>We almost missed it. The fog banks were so thick that I couldn't see my fingers when I held my hand out in front of me. Once we've gotten closer using the rowing boat, we'll have to remember to designate a meeting place and light a fire there to mark the spot. Maybe later on, we could even build a lighthouse!</p>\n<p>I keep thanking Enutrof for having guided us this far. Finally, I won't have to listen to that Sram groaning all day long... What kind of person comes on a trip like this knowing that they get seasick?!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Vulkania is a geologist's dream! The variety of mineral structures takes my breath away. The tranquil atmosphere is awe-inspiring. If it wasn't for the waves crashing, I reckon you'd almost be able to hear the rock all around slowly cracking.</p>\n<p>Seismic activity here seems limited. We've already spotted a number of craters in the forest. Stok and Stak went to investigate further. Soon, we should be able to draw up a rough map of the island.</p>\n<p>We all went down into the first crater. It was magnificent. The size of the crystals is something else. Hartvigg and Ava couldn't believe their eyes!</p>\n<p>Zubert got excited too when he spied some kind of creature in the cavern. I don't know what it was, but it was quite shy: the animal fled as soon as Zubert tried to get closer. It was the first big animal we've seen. Let's just say that Vulkania's forests weren't made for hunting.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>We've been here for a good while now and we're getting to know the archipelago's terrain quite well.</p>\n<p>Zubert thinks he's identified the species of creature that we see from time to time: they're Dreggons. He has a friend who specialises in these animals, and he suggested we invite him to the island. I gave him my approval.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I had an idea, which I explained to the rest of the team: what if we made Vulkania into a big natural park, so that everyone could discover the delights this extraordinary place has to offer? Hartvigg was up for it immediately – probably calculating how much gold a park like that might rake in. Stok seemed hesitant, however; he'll take some convincing. He's probably scared that the place will be completely overrun with tourists! I'll need to reassure him about that, because it's not at all what we have in mind.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>To pass the time, we've already starting brainstorming about all the interesting attractions we could offer visitors. Things like \"underground monsters and legends\", \"flight over a crater\" or \"journey not quite to the centre of the Earth\". The most important thing is to keep it educational, so that visitors to Vulkania can learn things while having fun.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Tristan Zubert's friend arrived this morning. He seems a little strange – very pale with bulging eyes – but he's very polite and well educated. I think he just has trouble sleeping.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Zubert's in his element; we've started seeing Dreggons in the forest. Zubert says they're immature, which is why they're still in their shells.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>We've welcomed the first visitors to Vulkania. Having them here enables us to test out the first activities that we've organised. For the moment, they seem to be enjoying themselves, so we're optimistic about keeping the project going!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>I don't know where to start... Something terrible happened today.</p>\n<p>We had gone down into the Pinki Crater to make some observations. It's the island's smallest crater, but the caverns it leads to are enormous. We went further than we had the other times... and it got hotter and hotter. We went through a kind of passage formed naturally in the rock... and there, in a big, rocky room... we saw them. Two enormous monsters, fast asleep, and all around them... hordes of Dreggons, still in their shells. The Dreggons started to get agitated, the noise was deafening... and the two giant creatures woke up.</p>\n<p>I truly thought we were going to die down there! By Enutrof, I've never been so frightened in all my life!</p>\n<p>Zubert's friend told us that the two creatures we had disturbed were Grozilla and Grasmera, and that they were most likely the Dreggons' fathers!</p>\n<p>Grozilla and Grasmera... what does this mean for everything we've started here?!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>So many things have happened... all our hopes have crumbled like a sandcastle washed away by the waves.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Several members of the expedition have disappeared. Tristan Zubert, his monster-obsessed friend, and my dear friend Ava... They went down into the Pinki Crater and they haven't come back. I tried to talk them out of going... but they wanted to see what there was beyond the den. I have given up hope of seeing them return alive.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The \"Sauroshells\", as Zubert called them, have come out of the deep caverns and are now roaming around the island's forests. We've had to start hunting them, because there were more and more of them.</p>\n<p>Alas, the opposite is true for the number of park visitors; fewer and fewer people arrive each day. As for the park's maintenance costs... well... If things don't sort themselves out, we're going to have to close the island off.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Hartvigg thinks he's found a way to save Vulkania. Apparently, he received a message from someone who might be able to help us.</p>\n<p>It's our last chance, because our situation couldn't be more hopeless. In the last few days, we've fallen victim to a number of thefts – as though a natural park were the place for thieves to hang around! I even have a hunch that some of our equipment has been sabotaged, because there have been several accidents. I don't understand any of it. It's as though fate has it in for us...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Today we met our \"saviour\": Charlie Endstown-Smisse. This gentleman, who appears to be most influential, has offered to take charge of everything. He said we needn't worry any more and that everything will be \"just hunky-dory\". Hmmm. I don't know why, but the whole thing makes me uneasy. I think the other members of the team have their doubts as well, but they haven't said anything to me. In fact, they don't talk much to me at all any more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>***</p>\n<p></p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Everything has changed.

If that's the case, he's succeeded... Thankfully, I have Dekster here to keep me company.</p>\n<p>The old expedition members eventually accepted the jobs that the Agents offered them. I'm not really in close contact with any of them these days. I thought we were in it together... but it turns out it's every man for himself.</p>\n<p>Now, Charlie's Agents control the whole island. The new employees are on their way now... and hundreds of tourists will be on the next boats.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>I don't feel like keeping this journal any more...

Not everybody is talented enough to have a petsmount, y'know!</p>\n<p>You've probably grasped by now that your petsmount is a very special creature.

They generally harbour an impressive amount of ill will for their own, and they can only feed on vengeance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And so, to gain nourishment, soul-eaters need only to accompany you when you kill monsters of their ilk, at which point they will feed on the souls you've freed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soul-eaters will gladly consume the souls of their own species at any time of day or night. They can fast for long periods, and are also able to devour large numbers of souls in a very short amount of time. It is impossible to make a soul-eater overweight or underweight.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After eating a certain number of souls, your Madreggon will see their characteristics increase.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class6'>Treating Injuries</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When injured, your Madreggon will need to follow a special diet of Eniripsa Powder, which can be used to heal petsmounts.

The young Rykke Errel, a fearless Iop, was the only one courageous enough to face the creature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Instead of reducing it to dust (and \"dust\" is an understatement), as he could easily have done, the dragon bowed down before the young knight and swore loyalty to him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Months went by. The two friends strolled across the fields, frolicked through the land of Amakna making jokes, drank ice-cold beer in the sunshine – it was a curious sight to most people's eyes. After all, dragons and knights would usually be seen fighting to the death over a young lady (and, to be more precise, whether the lady should be pure, as the knight preferred, or char broiled, as the dragon preferred).</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>As is often the case in myths and tales, Rykke was not only young but also very handsome. Legend knows not whether he was rich or poor, but we can probably assume that he was anything but a lowly beggar. Anyway, one day he met Helsephine, a sorceress who also happened to be young and beautiful, and he fell madly in love with her.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Yet, they didn't live happily ever! Is there any justice in this world? Read on!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Rykke was very happy to be able to introduce his lady-love to his friend Bolgrot. There was no way he could have guessed what was going to happen. The dragon, mad with jealous rage, killed sweet Helsephine and flew far away, destroying everything in his path – quite disruptive for the neighbours! Rykke set off after the dragon. When he found him, the old friends confronted one another in a titanic fight. Rykke's magic and weapons succeeded in bringing Bolgrot down, but the young hero was fatally injured in the battle, and died shortly afterwards.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>That's when the story took a rather odd twist... Looking for an explanation for Bolgrot's rage, Amakna's wise men discovered six strangely coloured eggs within the beast's entrails: they were genuine dragon eggs! The wise men had a feeling that these eggs would provide their bearer with a power that would make them the gods' equal... They took the decision to hide these terrible relics from the eyes of the world.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the centuries rolled by, the secret was so well-guarded that, in the end, it was completely forgotten... almost...</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"275":{"id":275,"typeId":1,"titleId":"The Crimson Dawn (part 1)","authorId":"Acidrik Gutsplitter","subTitleId":"Found Fragments - Part IX","contentId":"<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>The World of Twelve was plunged into an era of darkness. No one knew it yet but the soft, harmonious aura of the Dofus in which the World had previously bathed had been tainted.

This was not to be, such was the fear their fate inspired in those who heard about it. If their story has survived long enough to reach our ears, it is only because it was recounted secretly, in low voices during late-night gatherings... a warning to foolhardy and careless youths.</p>\n<p>Besides these whispered night-time stories, there is no proof to be found, as all the knights disappeared, body and soul, on one cold night in Septangel. It was at the beginning of the World...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Rushu had crushed a piece of Xelor's Clock and imposed Djaul as the protector of Descendre. Since then, the World had lived in the fearful shadow of Rushu's henchman, who had killed the great Solar with his own hands. And though his attempt at stealing the Dofus guarded by Aguabrial had been unsuccessful, it had led to the birth of a quick-tempered and unpredictable dragon named Bolgrot. Something told Djaul that, sooner or later, he would be able to use the dragon to his advantage. All of this created a sense of instability across the World, and the protective aura of the Dofus became sullied by such intense greed...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Despite this, Rushu remained unsatisfied. The lord of the demons wanted to become a god too, to be venerated by followers made in his image. But he had been refused! And a goddess called Sacrier had snatched his place in the pantheon for herself! By way of compensation, Rushu had asked Djaul to build a whole city in his honour. This city would become his temple, and he would have his followers! For Rushu intended to convert the other gods' disciples to worship him: they would sport red wings and would look like demons! And that's how the city of Brakmar, built in one night by Rushu himself, was devoted to the demon lord's sect...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Xelor, meanwhile, had decided that Jiva was worthy of succeeding Solar. He had also asked Menalt, centaur warrior and commander of the Order of the Valiant Heart, to be the protector of Martalo, the month of storms and showers. Menalt accepted. Just like Jiva and Pouchecot, the protectors of Javian and Frauguctor respectively, he had moved into the brand new city of Bonta. One month had been long enough for the three protectors to build the city, with the help of the ten gods. The city was built to counter the rise of Brakmar and the cult of Rushu. A year passed before it faced its first battle.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Septangel 12 of the year 26. The dawn was cold, and light could barely penetrate the morning gloom. The Bontarian outposts, held by the knights of the Order, were white with the first signs of frost, the sentinels numb from the early onset of winter. They huddled around the braziers, trying in vain to warm up. The forest, whose multitude of little noises usually started rustling to life at this hour of the morning, was completely silent, but for a cry that had been heard several times during the night. At first, the sentinels had paid it no heed, but now they squinted into the distance towards its apparent source in the south. The cry – surely produced by some completely ordinary creature, they told themselves – was getting closer.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The faction captain suspected some kind of ruse from the enemy. The Brakmarians had been very quiet lately, probably too quiet. He sent a messenger to Bonta. Suddenly, the dark stillness before them started to toss restlessly; there was something moving, just out of view of the sentinels! After a few astonished seconds, they rushed to the alarm bells... but it was too late! A wild clamour drowned out the ringing. The knights heard the echo of drumbeats. They were under attack! Troops piled up on both sides of the mounts of Sidimote and streamed down towards them. The commotion shook the very earth. And still, dawn did not break.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>In Bonta, Jiva had raised the alarm and was preparing the militia: if the attack reached the city, they would have to face the enemy. She urged the defenders on, stationing archers at arrow slits and infantrymen behind the doors. They could hear the muffled pounding of the marching troops from beyond the outer walls. The enemy was gaining ground, and fast! This was not a good sign... Now Menalt and Pouchecot were at Jiva's side. After a quick exchange, the three of them reached an agreement. Jiva would be in charge of the city's defence. By common accord, Menalt and Pouchecot each took the head of a squad composed of fifty knights of the Order of the Valiant Heart, a good half of whom were centaurs obeying Menalt's orders, and the rest of whom were ferociously armed infantry.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Swords drawn, they rushed out to help their comrades, bellowing \"Bonta shall triumph!\" Alas! Far away in the distance, the outposts had been swallowed up the by horde of goblins. No fewer than forty knights had perished, engulfed by their numbers. Reinforcements had arrived too late. The Bontarian troops sped up and the centaurs galloped faster than ever. The goblins were no doubt just the start of the attack being launched against Bonta.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Enemies swarmed before them. Dawn seemed to be suspended, the night never-ending. Suddenly, a jet of pale grey flames blazed over the goblin troops, casting a weak light over the battle. That sinister cry sounded once more. The Brakmarians had swept away the Bontarian outposts. In front of him, Menalt watched in dismay as the last knights were chased and finished off by Karne Riders. They were commanded by a Brakmarian captain, a dark Iop who himself stayed back from the front line.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"Brakmar's forces are considerable but not invincible!\" said Pouchecot. \"Your centaurs must smash into the sides of the enemy troops. The goblins will be closed in from both sides. Then I'll crush them and we can take on the Brakmarian war chiefs with our full force! You know as well as I that most creatures under Brakmarian command are unruly, brainless brutes. They'll flee if their command structure is beheaded. Then we'll deal with whatever's producing that devilish cry!\" Thus spoke Pouchecot, and Menalt nodded solemnly.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The knights surged in to attack the goblin troops... Slaughter! Carnage! Massacre! The Bontarian heroes brandished their blades and their breastplates were spattered with fresh blood with each blow! They finally stopped to catch their breath. The knights gathered around Menalt and Pouchecot. They hadn't borne any losses, just a few surface wounds. Menalt took a look around him to size up the extent of the battle's damage. The attack had gone well. Very well. Too well. The centaur scanned the surroundings for the dark Iop he had spotted earlier. The warrior had joined the rest of the Brakmarian troops and now appeared to be harnessing the troops' thirst for violence. Why hadn't this army of Chafer skeletons come to save the goblins...? Menalt realised they had made a mistake. A deafening cry split the darkness, accompanied by another flash of grey lightning. The goblins had been a trap! The worst was yet to come...</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n.document_content2_en-class6 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class7 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n"},"276":{"id":276,"typeId":1,"titleId":"The Crimson Dawn (part 2)","authorId":"Acidrik Gutsplitter","subTitleId":"Found Fragments - Part X","contentId":"<p>There was a warrior, a single, enormous warrior wearing black armour approaching them now. He came alone, and the Brakmarians parted to let him pass. He roared and the Bontarians around him crumpled and fell to the ground. Angered at seeing his knights recoil like this, Menalt urged them to fight. He raised his spear above his head and hurled himself into the attack. Pouchecot shouted at him to wait but the centaurs were already on their way to attack the first enemy lines. The collision was terrible, metal clashed against metal, the horns of war were blown and the drums beaten loudly. Cutting and thrusting, Menalt forced his way through towards the Brakmarian war chief. If he fell, victory would be Bonta's! Menalt could see the warrior fighting. With each of his blows, a knight collapsed, his armour slashed open by the black sword. The tip of his blade curved and circled smoothly through the air; it was as though two dark wings were whipping to and fro around him. The black warrior had the same intention as Menalt.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"I am Menalt, commander of the Order of the Valiant Heart, Protector of Martalo! Whoever you are, your hours are numbered!\" shouted Menalt over the commotion. Battle was raging all around them. Menalt had taken his armour off – far from protecting him, it was hindering his movements before his fearsome adversary.</p>\n<p>\"I'm going to take back your ill-gotten gains, centaur! Pray to your god, that he open the gates to the kingdom of the dead for you and for your knights! And tell him that Hyrkul will bring Bonta down today!\" Streams of black smoke were billowing from his helmet. Menalt, who was seeing him up close for the first time, was stunned to see that his enemy was able to use black fire as a weapon. \"Sacrilege!\" he exclaimed. \"You sully the fire of Ouronigride and you will be cursed for it!\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"My name is Hyrkul and it'll follow you into the other world, centaur!\" screamed the other, and both of them rushed forward to strike. In less than a second, everything was over. Menalt brandished his spear, whose point glowed with white fire. He lunged forward, aiming at the hollow of the throat where the plates of the black armour were spaced out enough for his blow to be lethal. But the warrior dodged and the spear jabbed uselessly into the darkness. Hyrkul's wide, shadowy wings swirled to lash and blind the centaur. Before the centaur could launch a second attack, Hyrkul grabbed his spear in one hand, and his throat in the other. They both bellowed, one in rage and the other in pain. A blaze of lightning sprang from the black helmet, hitting Menalt in the face for a few seconds that seemed like an eternity. Then the warrior pushed the stunned and twitching centaur back to deliver the deathblow. He twirled his sword; the blade spun with a whistling sound and cut swiftly downwards. Menalt dropped noiselessly into the dust.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The warrior kept on spinning his sword and bellowing. An intense burst of fire shot from the back of his throat and set his blade alight. The flame caught and spread, growing ever wider and more dangerous. The knights had seen their chief fall and had started to retreat in horror. Then, a dragon of black lightning materialised from the end of Hyrkul's sword. The beast reared up to its full height, towering over them all, and then dove downwards through the Bontarian troops, who caught fire instantly. Knights fell one after the other, and the other Bontarian warriors were blown away by the explosion. Pouchecot only survived thanks to his magic. He shot roots deep down into the earth, like a hundred-year-old tree. The battlefield was strewn with the cracked armour of fallen knights. A freezing rain started to pour down. The Brakmarian troops started to make their way towards Bonta. Hyrkul turned to face the gigantic tree that Pouchecot had become. His transformation protected him from danger, but prevented him from moving. The black giant roared with spine-chilling laughter.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>\"I shall carve your coffin in your own wood, Pouchecot! But first... I want to see Jiva's head hanging in your branches!\" He spat and strode away to join his army. The fortified walls of Bonta stood out in the distance, as pale as chalk.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The knights of the Order of the Valiant Heart had all perished...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It seemed to the defenders of Bonta that day would never break again. Was this night the last they would ever live to see? Jiva was not the only one staring up at the sky, trying to penetrate the mysteries of the curse bearing down upon them. Raval, the protector of Septangel, had climbed to the top of the Sidimote hills to study the battlefield and the persistent, jinxed darkness. Five hours! The sun should have been out for five hours already! These hours were precious to him, the protector of Septangel. Five hours had been stolen from the month he was supposed to protect... He would have to explain this to Xelor!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The black warrior was extremely powerful. Exterminating a hundred knights was one thing. Annihilating Menalt was another. But rendering Pouchecot powerless... Was there no limit to the warrior's power?</p>\n<p>\"If I try to stand between him and Bonta to reclaim my stolen hours, I risk being killed... As for Bonta, my dear Jiva, you're dead meat... But if Bonta falls, this night might last for eternity... and that will be the end of Septangel.\" Raval could not bear to imagine that. He went down to the battlefield. The goblins that had survived the battle were forming a hobbling rear guard. There, amidst goblin corpses and empty armour, Raval had the idea that was to save Septangel. The same man who strove to suck the life out of every plant and flower as soon as Frauguctor's back was turned was about to breathe life back into the souls of the dead knights. He had that power...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>At his command, the ghosts of the knights of the Order of the Valiant Heart rose. Their discarded armour hit the ground with metallic thuds. Burnt, flayed and cut, they all bore gaping wounds. Raval walked through the ranks in silence, then pointed towards the Brakmarian army. Hyrkul's troops had reached the gates of Bonta. Any minute now, they were going to give way to the Trools' steady hammering. Militia men, gathered by Jiva, had formed a wall of armour. But goblins were already trying to sneak in through the gaps in the door, which were widening with each passing second. Hyrkul had put his sword back in its sheath and was striking with his mace. All of a sudden, he paused mid-motion, and turned back as though someone had called out to him...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Cries of distress were coming from the back. The huge warrior, taken aback, listened carefully. It was not the cries of fear that worried him. He had cast his eyes to the south. And there he saw his troops being overcome by the knights of the Order – the very same knights he had killed with his black lightning! This white tide rolled slowly over the Brakmarians. Just then, Bonta's horns rang out. Jiva had opened up the doors and the militia was moving forward to take on the Brakmarian troops, taking back the ground that had been conquered, metre by metre.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Hyrkul had not foreseen such a reversal of fortune. The Brakmarian troops were caught in a stranglehold. He watched as the ghostly knights, immune to blows, hacked his army to pieces. The confusion was total. His captain was beating a retreat. Goblins and Chafers tried to flee but were killed on the spot by ghost knights. He struggled to extricate himself from the fray, and, knowing the battle was lost, Hyrkul glanced one last time at Bonta, so close, before fleeing towards the Treechnid Forest. He may not have been victorious, but now he knew for sure that Bonta did not have any Dofus. Jiva and Pouchecot would not have hesitated to brandish them at the battle's most critical moment, to show their power and scare the Brakmarian troops away... This simple detail was worth all the losses the troops of Brakmar had borne... Hyrkul disappeared into the dark forest.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>A cry of victory went up throughout Bonta. The survivors could finally see daybreak. Raval climbed back up the Sidimote hills to watch Brakmar's retreat. The dawn was crimson. And this colour was to lend its name to this historic battle in the tales later told of it. \"The Crimson Dawn\" was the first battle in which Bonta and Brakmar had fought one another, and one of the bloodiest in the period that came to be known as \"the war of the cities\".</p>\n<p></p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"277":{"id":277,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Esra'Ruoy'Dnim's Invasion","authorId":"Fecaline the Wise","subTitleId":"How a shepherd became king of Amakna","contentId":"<p>Four Rings in the Sky: p. 3</p>\n<p>The Broken Pact: p. 5</p>\n<p>Devastation and Desolation: p. 6</p>\n<p>Amakna Subjugated by Demons: p. 7</p>\n<p>Allister's Guild: p. 8</p>\n<p>The Ruse: p. 10</p>\n<p>Allister's Triumph: p. 11</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Four Rings in the Sky</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One cursed day, the wise men discovered that the Bolgrot the dragon's eggs had disappeared.

One word was oft repeated during evening gatherings – a word at first whispered in hushed tones, a foreign word full of strange sounds, a word that people did not trust... And the old storytellers, those elders who spoke the ancient dragon language, were suddenly the centre of kind attention. They knew that in dragon language, the word \"Dofus\" meant \"dragon egg\". They knew of Rykke Errel's adventures... And in truth, since people would buy them drinks just to hear the tale, they weren't about to miss an opportunity to tell it to anyone who cared to listen!

How could they have believed that the demons had come through space by clumsy accident, as if slipping on a slimy larva skin? That they'd leave the way they came, after eating a few Gobballs and fewer than a dozen lords... At the time, the wise men thought that the Demons of the Hours were just playing a trick.

The young boy had grown into a fine Feca known for his daring. He was the shepherd of the largest flock of Gobballs in Amakna. The invaders, for their part, saw Amakna as a vast playground. They never guessed that those who would later come to be called \"Allister's Guild\" – for now a group of inexperienced youths and old men – would be their downfall.</p>\n<p>One morning, while leading his flock to the fields, Allister met a Feca Lady wearing a horned crown upon her head. A Feca from the upper classes? A princess? Or a queen? The goddess herself? With a gesture, she interrupted his questions and, without opening her mouth, she told him that he, Allister, could bring about the demons' downfall... provided he used neither force nor weapons. But Allister still needed to figure out how to put the Lady's revelation to good use.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>If you have read this far, dear Reader, you should know that Allister was the youngest of a long line of Feca shepherds. And if the goddess Feca had chosen him – as indeed she had – it was for a reason. His family was renowned for its famous boiled Gobball black pudding (nonetheless, that is not why he was chosen). His father, and his father's father before him, used a magical object to fatten their beasts: a fetter made of four metallic heads. A snap of the jaws of two of these heads would clamp metal bracelets around a beast's legs, and the other two would open them when it was time to release the beast. This curious object called the \"Trip Trap Shackles\", which until then had served only to shackle Gobballs, would imprison the cruellest creature that Amakna had ever seen.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The Ruse</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Allister decided to sacrifice his entire flock of Gobballs in honour of Esra'Ruoy'Dnim. Ignoring the crowd of Amaknians who booed and whistled, he bled his beasts and offered the demon hundreds of barrels full of Gobball haemoglobin.

Instead, we're going to look at the second most important condition: proper feeding.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This guide tells you how to feed Slayhounds, fearsome soul-eating critters!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Petsmounts</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Slayhounds aren't pets, they're petsmounts – faithful companions that you can count on in any situation, but that you can also ride!</p>\n<p>Seated on your Slayhound's back, your hair blowing in the wind and the reins between your teeth, you'll no longer have to cross the wide World of Twelve all alone. You'll be able to flounce around Astrub's little squares smiling haughtily amidst the envious gazes of your observers. Not everybody is talented enough to have a petsmount, y'know!</p>\n<p>You've probably grasped by now that your petsmount is a very special creature. You'll need to feed it, cherish it and treat it properly if you want it to stay in good health.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Feeding Your Petsmount</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soul-eating petsmounts are quite unique, to say the least. They generally harbour an impressive amount of ill will for certain creatures, and they can only feed on vengeance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And so, to gain nourishment, soul-eaters need only to accompany you when you kill these monsters, at which point they will feed on the souls you've freed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soul-eaters will gladly consume the souls of creatures at any time of day or night. They can fast for long periods, and are also able to devour large numbers of souls in a very short amount of time. It is impossible to make a soul-eater overweight or underweight.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After eating a certain number of souls, your Slayhound will see their characteristics increase.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Treating Injuries</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When injured, your Slayhound will need to follow a special diet of Eniripsa Powder, which can be used to heal petsmounts. You can purchase this powder from the Bow Kennel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you haven't located Eniripsa Powder yet, you can bring your wounded petsmount to the Bow Kennel to keep its condition from worsening.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Your Slayhound's Diet</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Slayhound's diet is composed of the souls of other creatures who live on Kwismas Island.</p>\n<p>This diet enables it to be more powerful.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples the creatures whose souls Slayhounds can eat:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Kwismas Whitish Fang</p>\n<p>Prickies</p>\n<p>Kwismas Dragoturkeys</p>\n<p>Wintry Kanigers</p>\n<p>Snowmen</p>\n<p>Ice Cracklers</p>\n<p>Nefarious Goblimps</p>\n<p>Mini Inuits</p>\n<p>Father Kwismas</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some souls are richer than others, allowing your Slayhound to develop more quickly.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Using Your Petsmount in Combat</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Your petsmount will typically assist you in combat by defending you or helping to make your attacks more effective.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Be sure to keep a close eye on your petsmount, though, because it will be injured every time you lose a fight against a creature.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you don't heal it after each loss, it will eventually die, and you'll have to find a way to revive your petsmount.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In general, the only way to heal a petsmount after losing a battle is to feed it Eniripsa Powder.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Customarily, when adventurers fight one another, petsmounts are never targeted. Therefore, they cannot be injured, even in the event of a defeat.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to be sure your petsmount doesn't get injured, simply keep it in your inventory rather than having it by your side during combat.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Favourite Area</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All petsmounts have a favourite area.</p>\n<p>Whenever a petsmount is in its favourite area, all the benefits it gives its master receive a bonus. The bonus changes from petsmount to petsmount, but it can be very large, so don't forget to take advantage of it by fighting in the area!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Slayhound's favourite area is Kwismas Island.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>About the Bow Kennel</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bow Kennel is a place generally reserved for raising petsmounts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can leave your petsmount there so it's safe and well-fed while you are away. However, your petsmount will not improve while in the Bow Kennel, as it is away from its master.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You typically have to pay a fee to drop off your petsmount, and then another fee when you pick it up later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The amount you have to pay will depend on how long you're gone for. The longer your petsmount stays in the Bow Kennel, the steeper the fee.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The Bow Kennel is also where you can buy Eniripsa Powder to heal your petsmount.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The most well-known Bow Kennel is usually marked on adventurers' maps. It can be found next to Sufokia Gate.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>In conclusion, we must point out a physical limit to your Slayhound's constitution.</p>\n<p>Once its growth is complete, its capacities will have reached their maximum and it will be difficult to improve it further.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Good luck to you and your soul-chomping petsmount!</p>","contentCSS":".document_content2_de-class6 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nli {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_it-class6 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n"},"296":{"id":296,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Hearts for Cuspular","authorId":"","subTitleId":"Where to Find Heart Boxes","contentId":"<p>Adventurers above level 19 can obtain a Tiny Heart Box from the following dungeon guardians:</p> <p>* Famished Sunflower</p> <p>* Sponge Mob</p> <p>* Royal Gobball</p> <pagefeed/> <p>Adventurers above level 39 can obtain a Small Heart Box from the following dungeon guardians:</p> <p>* Batofu</p> <p>* Boostache</p> <p>* Golden Scarabugly</p> <p>* Smiths' Chest</p> <p>* Kwakwa</p> <p>* Shin Larva</p> <p>* Bworkette</p> <p>* Bulbig</p> <p>* Great Coralator</p> <p>* Royal Blop except Rainbow</p> <p>* Wa Wabbit</p> <p>* Kanniball Andchain</p> <pagefeed/> <p>Adventurers above level 69 can obtain a Big Heart Box from the following dungeon guardians:</p> <p>* Nelween</p> <p>* Gourlo the Terrible</p> <p>* Legendary Crackler</p> <p>* Daggero</p> <p>* Royal Jelly</p> <p>* Ancestral Treechnid</p> <p>* Dragon Pig</p> <p>* Koolich</p> <p>* Moowolf</p> <p>* Moon</p> <pagefeed/> <p>Adventurers above level 109 can obtain an Enormous Heart Box from the following dungeon guardians:</p> <p>* Lord Crow</p> <p>* Black Rat</p> <p>* White Rat</p> <p>* Silf the Greater Bherb</p> <p>* Minotoror</p> <p>* Crocabulia</p> <p>* Pandora Master</p> <p>* Skeunk</p> <p>* Royal Rainbow Blop</p> <p>* Royal Mastogob</p> <p>* Royal Tofu</p> <p>* Tanukouï San</p> <p>* Soft Oak</p> <p>* Perfidious Tynril</p> <p>* Royal Pingwin</p> <p>* Peki Peki</p> <p>* Sphincter Cell</p> <p>* Buck Anear</p> <pagefeed/> <p>Adventurers above level 159 can obtain a Gigantic Heart Box from the following dungeon guardians:</p> <p>* Bworker</p> <p>* Obsidemon</p> <p>* Kimbo</p> <p>* Minotot</p> <p>* Tengu Snowfoux</p> <p>* Giant Kralove</p> <p>* Korriander</p> <p>* Kolosso</p> <p>* Grohlum</p> <p>* Celestial Bearbarian</p> <p>* Ougaa</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"297":{"id":297,"typeId":2,"titleId":"St. Ballotwine's Day","authorId":"","subTitleId":"Special Occasion","contentId":"<p>Saint Ballotwine <span class='document_content2_fr-class5'>is upon</span> us!

Nicholas was an Enutrof toymaker, and without doubt the best on all Frigost. He was also very generous, and once a year, in the month of Descendre, he tried to warm the chilly hearts of good children by giving them a toy he had crafted in his workshop.</p><pagefeed/><p>The small family business was growing by the day. To keep up with demand, Nicholas went into partnership with another Enutrof called Scooger, a fussy accountant with a strong practical side. Scooger set about dealing with the business side of things. He took on a group of Goblimps to increase production: these extremely skilled workers only wanted a few Iced Chestnuts as payment - which suited the miserly old Scooger no end - as well as the right to play a practical joke every now and again.</p><pagefeed/><p>Nicholas Kwismas was so popular that all of the children on Frigost talked about him day and night. His fame travelled quickly across the island, reaching the ears of certain unsavoury creatures.</p><p>One such creature, a child-eating monster that rampaged around a remote, dark forest, had an unpronounceable name and an empty belly. Struggling to find anything to satisfy his raging hunger, the unspeakable fiend hatched a Machiavellian plan. Why not use the toymaker's fame to attract children with gifts?</p><pagefeed/><p>Busy in his lair, the monster wrapped anything and everything in shiny paper, then placed gifts all over the forest. Most of the time, the colourful parcels were taken by wild creatures, but sadly, a few children fell blindly into the trap.</p><p>These few morsels served only to increase the ogre's hunger. To expand his hunting ground, he resolved to leave the forest and come out into the open - but he would never have dared to had he not had the heaven-sent help of an unscrupulous businessman.</p><pagefeed/><p>Bound by a deep hatred of Nicholas Kwismas and of joyful sentiment in general, this terrible twosome set up a toyshop in direct competition with Nicholas Kwismas. Their gifts were labelled \"from the real Father Kwismas\".</p><p>In a few short years, their business prospered, thanks largely to misleading advertising, bribes and various underhand tactics. After all, when someone is threatening to eat you, you tend to do what they say.</p><pagefeed/><p>Nicholas Kwismas and Scooger tried to react, but couldn't compete with such dishonest practices. The production of toys at the factory slowed right down, then ground to a halt.</p><p>Riddled with debt, Nicholas Kwismas had to make the Goblimps redundant. He had to sell his business and his house... which, inevitably, were bought by the twosome who brought about his downfall.</p><pagefeed/><p>They say that it never rains, but it pours. Nicholas Kwismas had just left his home when an earthquake shook the region. The frozen tip of land on which the Kwismas house stood was torn from Frigost Island and drifted slowly out to sea. There was nothing natural about this disaster, for it was the work of the demon Djaul, who hoped to use the curse on Frigost to freeze Amakna as well, and attempt once more to defeat Jiva, his eternal rival.</p><pagefeed/><p>And so, Nicholas Kwismas, his son Hector, his niece Carol, his associate Scooger and the Goblimp workers (who had stayed on despite being made redundant, for their stock of Iced Chestnuts had not yet run out) found themselves trapped on a tiny chunk of floating island, lost on the ocean. After a while, it became apparent that the imposter Father Kwismas was also part of this unexpected journey...</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"304":{"id":304,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Second Kwismas Carol","authorId":"Carol Kwismas","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p>The end of the year 639 was special, not just for the inhabitants of Kwismas Island, but for the people living on the continent as well.</p><p>In Descendre of that year, the keeper of the lighthouse at the edge of the world could see no sign of frozen land off the coast. The village of Amakna, however, was completely covered in snow - a sign of the island's influence on the weather.</p><p>Harry and Mary Kwismas, two Enutrofs who had recently set up camp to the west of the port of Madrestam, revealed the strange events that led to this unusual situation to an incredulous public.</p><pagefeed/><p>The two former adventurers, distant cousins of Nicholas Kwismas, had taken up residence on the frozen island to study it at the request of the scholars Khopen and Hagen. Well, that was the explanation they gave when asked about the reason for their presence on the island. In reality, the Enutrof couple had wanted to go into business selling toys from Father Kwismas's workshop.</p><pagefeed/><p>Mary and Harry then announced that they had noticed the climate changing over the past few months. The water temperature seemed to have risen, due largely to the growing number of adventurers, the rapid development of Dragoturkey breeding, and the large-scale, incessant deforestation. The underwater currents had been disrupted, and they had kept the island away from the continent.</p><pagefeed/><p>As if that were not worrying enough, the two Enutrofs told the public that a disaster had occurred. Chased from the Dreggon Peninsula in Novamaire by a group of bellicose heroes, the terrible Grozilla and Grasmera had escaped by sea, taking the last living Sauroshells with them. The two dragons had swum until they reached Kwismas Island. No sooner had they set their terrible claws on their new playground than they began to wreak havoc, massacring the indigenous Itztings and Mini Inuits.</p><pagefeed/><p>While all of the creatures on Kwismas Island were cowering in fear, something unexpected happened. The Sauroshells that Grozilla and Grasmera had stored in a cave for their protection reached maturity, and exploded all at once!</p><p>The explosion was so powerful that it propelled a chunk of Kwismas Island high into the air. This lump of snow and ice rose high into the sky, before falling and crashing straight into the village of Amakna.</p><pagefeed/><p>It was on this piece of ice that the Kwismas couple had made their camp, where they stored the gifts taken from the island's creatures, as well as sheltering a small group of Goblimp pranksters. Everything had miraculously survived the fall! However, once they had recovered from their initial shock, the Goblimps were eager to steal the presents from the Kwismases, and they ran off with them.</p><pagefeed/><p>And so, every year since the events of 639, Harry and Mary make an appeal to adventurers to help them to recover the gifts that the Goblimps stole. As the missing crates invariably end up in the hands of the guardians that rule the dungeons (no one ever takes them any gifts, after all, so they're forced to take them themselves without asking), they aren't easily recovered.

He had tried several times to attack the children who regularly came to visit Nicholas's workshop. Father Whupper hid under the stairs or in the dark corners of the toy factory, or behind the gift machines. He was most often spotted by the Goblimps, who didn't like him at all, for he didn't have even the slightest hint of a sense of humour.</p><pagefeed/><p>Nicholas tried to reason with the ogre, but it was like talking to a Iop. The treats he offered in exchange for a little restraint seemed to have no effect. Despite repeated warnings, Father Whupper always returned, drawn to the fresh meat.</p><pagefeed/><p>A worker called Blimpanzee, who like all Goblimps was a vegetarian, had the bright idea of changing the monster's diet. He tried everything: cabbage soup, onion soup, potato soup and stone soup; beetroot salad, turnip salad, Waldorf salad and cawwot salad; mushrooms stuffed à la Lykhen, stuffed with croutons, stuffed with stuffing, and stuffed with particularly salty almonds. Nothing worked, and things turned sour for Blimpanzee when one morning he did not appear for work. Many believed he had been eaten by Father Whupper. Others were more optimistic, and claimed that as a result of spending so much time in the ogre's company, he must have taken a liking to minced meat, and so moved to the Trool Fair to spend his days guzzling down almost nutritionally balanced meals at Maxim's.</p><pagefeed/><p>As every attempt to calm the monster failed, Nicholas resolved to use a firmer hand. With the help of a passing hunter who feared nothing but Arachnees, he prepared a trap to capture the beast. But nets alone were not enough to keep Father Whupper from escaping, and so Nicholas ended up locking the ugly beast in his cellar, where he remained for many years... until the house changed hands.</p><pagefeed/><p>The new owner, who was none other than the sinister Father Kwismas, was shocked to find this cumbersome tenant when he moved into Nicholas's former home. It turned out that Father Whupper was the more wicked of the two monsters. He mercilessly threw his opponent out of the house, and took possession of it himself.</p><pagefeed/><p>Beaten and humiliated, Father Kwismas took up residence in the depths of an ice cavern, plotting his revenge, and vowing to avenge the terrible affront he had suffered. But it takes energy to plot in such a fashion, and so the ogre set about filling his stomach, which isn't easy when one is exiled to an island in the middle of the ocean.</p><p></p><p>As for Father Whupper, he redecorated the house to his taste, and, for fun, started torturing the poor cuddly toys abandoned by the Goblimps.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"306":{"id":306,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Fourth Kwismas Carol","authorId":"Carol Kwismas","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p>The first Kwismas Carol tells of Nicholas the toymaker, ruined by an unscrupulous businessman, whose dark dealings led to the collapse of the Goblimps' workshop and who drove Nicholas out of his own house. But who was this businessman with dark designs, and what became of him?</p><pagefeed/><p>John Pesterton was an unbearable alchemist who had made his fortune by creating an allegedly miraculous beverage: Cocalane, \"the drink that makes everything fly by.\" This elixir, whose qualities were as questionable as they were numerous, was regularly imbibed by many Frigostians. It was served on the rocks, which was fortunate, given the island's climate.</p><p>Always seeking to expand his vast pile of kamas, Pesterton spoke to Nicholas Kwismas, suggesting they went into partnership together. If he could get all of the children on Frigost to drink Cocalane, it would be extremely profitable!</p><p>But Nicholas already had a partner - Scooger, the taciturn accountant. He quickly recognised Pesterton as being even more miserly than Scooger and flatly refused the wealthy alchemist's offer.</p><pagefeed/><p>Furious at having been turned down so brusquely, Pesterton decided to take revenge. Having heard several rumours that Kwismas was planning to open a subsidiary in a dark forest, he made his way into the snowy depths... and found himself face to face - or rather face to teeth - with a horrible creature.</p><p>After what must have been a rather tense discussion, the child-eating monster and Pesterton discovered they had something in common: a profound disdain for Nicholas Kwismas and joyful sentiment. That was all that was needed for an agreement to be reached between the two dreadful characters.</p><pagefeed/><p>Pesterton decided to invest part of his fortune in starting an anonymous enterprise to compete with Kwismas. Emphasising quantity over quality, he distributed gifts to everyone, including ne'er-do-wells, wandering monsters and crooks of the worst kind. Even the brainless bots would have received something had they been on Frigost. The presents were labelled \"from the real Father Kwismas\".</p><p>The role of Father Kwismas was given to the monster, who was delighted with the scheme: with such a clever disguise, he could assume the false identity and finally leave the forest.</p><pagefeed/><p>The evil plan worked. Nicholas Kwismas's tiny business could not compete with Pesterton's underhand methods. The old craftsman had to put his keys under the door and sell his house. To top it all, Djaul's evil intervention tore him from his homeland, sending him wandering on an icy sea, far from the children of Frigost who gradually forgot about him...</p><pagefeed/><p>With Nicholas off on a very long cruise, Pesterton's vengeance was assuaged. There was no point carrying on distributing gifts, and besides, it was no longer profitable. So Pesterton put an end to his activity as a manufacturer of low-end toys. With Father Kwismas no longer there to terrorise reluctant clients, Pesterton's business failed. Cocalane sales stagnated and then collapsed. Pesterton decided to sneak away into the night, leaving with a bag full of kamas, and nothing more was heard of him. Some say he tried to contact Count Harebourg and offer him a fantastic deal...</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva,

It would first manifest as a bodily imbalance. Some pets would grow huge but their skin would burn. Others became quick as the wind yet extremely sensitive to cold... But they all inevitably died.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Silouate, the guardian of Aperirel, attempted to cast a spell to save the poor beasts.

They generally harbour an impressive amount of ill will for their own, and they can only feed on vengeance.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And so, to gain nourishment, soul-eaters need only to accompany you when you kill monsters of their ilk, at which point they will feed on the souls you've freed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Soul-eaters will gladly consume the souls of their own species at any time of day or night. They can fast for long periods, and are also able to devour large numbers of souls in a very short amount of time.

However, your pet will not improve while in the Bow Kennel, as it is away from its master.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You typically have to pay a fee to drop off your pet, and then another fee when you pick it up later.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The amount you have to pay will depend on how long you're gone for.

Legend says that Osamodas had a Gobball called Gobby that he loved very much. He would often walk with him across the fields and prairies, letting him graze tufts of the most exquisite grass. But one day, while the god was taking care of his other pets, he left Gobby all alone in his meadow.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>A rather hungry Iop disciple happened to pass by and decided Gobby would make a delicious lunch. This Iop's name was Gragrantwa and he was a mammoth of a being who was hungry all the time, even after lunch! Hopping along like a Wabbit, but much slyer, he caught the Gobball and devoured it in one. Other than a few crumbs of horn and a ragged carcass, nothing remained of the poor beast. Burping noisily and with great satisfaction, Gragrantwa, now well fed, laid his head down to rest.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Later, Osamodas returned to his beast only to find the poor Gobball's skeleton and the Iop napping contentedly nearby. The horrified god released all his fury; with great strength and force, he cracked his whip, killing Gragrantwa in one mighty blow. He turned to the remains of his Gobball and glumly gathered them together before sticking them up in the vault of heaven, transforming them into honorary little stars. Thus, the first constellation of the Doziak was born.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Born Under the Sign of Gobball:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Adventurers born under the sign of Gobball are impulsive. Confronted by the smallest obstacle, Gobballs will charge, heads down, even if it means chipping their horns on the way. Their spontaneous character sometimes drives them to commit acts that they may end up regretting. Gobballs are known to go against their parents and become the Black Gobbly of their family, but don't automatically think they're bad people. No. They'll be happy enough following the herd without further questions.

The shield goddess admired the animal and its proud armour, and she said to herself that this creature would make a charming companion, perfectly symbolising the idea of protection. She tried to catch it to make it her pet, but the crab became jittered. Annoyed to have been woken from its sleep, it closed in on the goddess's foot and pinched at her toe before scurrying away. Feca jumped with surprise, furious at having been attacked, and chased the crustacean.

It grabbed the guardian in its jaws and swam with all its might to bring her up to the surface.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>On the surface, Jiva regained consciousness and rushed towards Djaul to wreak vengeance. Feeling stronger than ever, it didn't take long for her to get one up on him as she drove her knee into the one place it hurts the most. Finally, the demon was temporarily incapable of hurting a Piwi, and the relieved Jiva let out an almighty sigh. Then, she remembered the courageous animal that had saved her from the abysmal depths. To thank it and congratulate it on its courage, she decided to decorate the sky in homage. Her fingers still wet with seawater, she took some droplets and magically transformed them into stars to place in the sky.

I also read soles, Bwork runes and Feca markers.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>As a highly reputable astrologer, I would like to respond to the recent declarations of certain scientomagi who have been spreading absurd theories about the nature of our universe. The Krosmoz, they say, is a sort of cosmic egg, or an astral omelette... I can't remember which exactly. Let's be honest... That's all a bunch of nonsense! Why not a celestial poultry party, whilst we're at it?! Hahaha! But seriously, any sane adventurer knows full well that the World of Twelve is flat and that the sky is a round, solid archway that a giant firefly, the Sun, crawls round and round on! No need to be a scientomagus to work that one out!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Hmmm, but since these cheap theorists believe they can just go around telling lies, I need to set a few things straight. As I was saying just the other day to my colleague Paro Cabanne, not enough people know what goes on up in the sky. Take these Doziak constellations, for example. I am absolutely alarmed to learn that they aren't common knowledge for all! Some people don't even know what the Doziak is! That's just outrageous!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>That's why I, Yova Etna, great sibyl approved by the Amaknian Horoscopists League, grant you my great bounty of knowledge, to light up your lives. As you surely already know, the celestial archway spans the World of Twelve and orbits around it as the seasons pass. If the stars look like they're moving, it's only because they're stuck up there on the canvas and follow its every movement.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Every day the Sun makes its way across the sky with its great golden firefly feet. But, far from blindly feeling for its way, it follows a predefined path, occasionally dwelling on certain constellations. It especially appreciates the company of animals, given that these constellations represent the creatures that you will find in our world. Together, these clusters of stars, twelve in total, form what we call the Doziak. It's as simple as that!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Let's get on to the practical aspect and see how all this concerns us directly. When an adventurer is incarnated, the position of the Sun in the Doziak will indicate which astrological sign it will be. For example, if the Sun is in the Gobball constellation when you are incarnated, in astrological jargon we would say that you were born under the sign of Gobball, or, simply, that you are Gobball.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Fret not, you're hardly going to start grazing grass! No, knowing your astrological sign simply allows a qualified astrologer (such as myself!) to give you a heap of information about you as a person: the day you'll have your first Tofu-burger, the hour of your 34th defeat, the name of your first Bow Meow, the year of your first holiday on Otomai, the colour your toe will go when you get stepped on by a Crackler and all those kind of things, you know? You have so much to learn before you can start calling yourself a dignified adventurer!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>To sum it up, the signs of the Doziak can teach you various things about yourself. Once you know who you are and what your future holds, you'll have no reason to fear the Dragon Pig... or getting into a passionate relationship with a charming Sadida clairvoyant weighing in at 110 kilopods! Oooh... cheeky!</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class6 {\n\tlist-style-type: circle;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"335":{"id":335,"typeId":1,"titleId":"The Curse of Al Howin","authorId":"Anonymous","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p>Every year at the end of Octolliard, the curse of Al Howin takes over the World of Twelve. Its nasty tendrils transmogrify the gentle Tofus and Gobballs into frightening, blood-thirsty creatures. Take heed, this curse is catching, it can easily jump from monsters to adventurers!</p>\n<p>But how did it all begin?</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It all started with a contest... Not very long ago, in a region not very far from you, there was a contest to see who could grow the biggest Pumpkwin in Lousy Pig slurry. Extremely renowned among the farmers and fans of succulent squash in the region, this contest was a springboard to wealth for all Pumpkwin farmers. Indeed, taking home first place guaranteed the winner would have a monopoly over the Pumpkwin trade for the whole year.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>That year, the competition was stiff, and no one could predict with certainty how the contest would end. Al Howin was among the favourites, however, and he was expected to perform very well. Indeed, he had taken home the trophy fifteen years in a row. And he was used to proclaiming that he was, quite simply, the finest Pumpkwin grower the continent had ever seen... and no one could contradict him on that point. Unfortunately for the Pumpkwin champion, his harvest was late this time, and his Pumpkwins were far from ripe. In truth, his fields were full of ridiculous tiny Pumpkwins. He was going to be the laughing stock of the Pumpkwin-growing profession, and was at risk of losing his unique source of wealth forever... For Al Howin, that was unacceptable.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>What people do not necessarily know is that even a trade as consuming as Pumpkwin farming leaves plenty of time for thumb twisting. And Al Howin had been twiddling his thumbs in all the wrong places of late, mostly as the apprentice of a certain Bwork Magus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Terrified by his looming defeat, and refusing categorically to go back to the mediocrity of run-of-the-mill dirt-farming, Al Howin asked this Bwork Magus to try an untested incantation on his Pumpkwins. The results were not slow in coming. In the space of a few seconds, Al Howin's field turned a deep orange colour...</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Al Howin watched his Pumpkwins grow, and grow, and grow... until they were so huge they rivalled the backside of a Mama Bwork. Victory was within his grasp, and more than that: Al Howin was on the path to glory!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the day of the contest came, the deliberations were rapid. Not a single farmer even came close to rivalling Al Howin and he took hope the Golden Pumpkwin trophy once again.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>There was a great feast after the festival, and Al Howin was far from modest in sympathising with the competition. But rather like a carefully crafted sword in the hands of a murderous champion, the Bwork spell did indeed have a double edge: Pumpkwin growth was not the only thing affected by the incantation... While he was celebrating, Al Howin's unwatched fields began to rustle with another kind of life altogether: Gobballs. They were hungry and they were mindless and all they saw were the enchanted Pumpkwins. One bite was enough: they were immediately transformed into hideous, deformed creatures... Panicked and outraged by their new appearance, the Gobballs attacked, spreading panic throughout the festivities. Just when it seemed it could get no worse, it was discovered that the curse was contagious! Simple contact with the beasts was all it took to be transformed in turn!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The panic eventually died down and, after several days, it was noted that the transformation was only temporary... A cure to the \"curse-that-could-get-no-worse\" (as the papers called it) was also discovered, quite by accident when a child tried to hide in a hollow Pumpkwin. Indeed, the effects of the curse could be reversed by wearing a healthy Pumpkwin on one's head. The Bwork Magus works in mysterious ways... And luckily so.</p>\n<p>Al Howin's cheating was soon unmasked, and his association with the Bwork Magus soundly condemned.

Just like the experience point bonuses, they can apply to certain types of monster, specific monsters, geographical areas or, more rarely, groups of monsters which all have something in common.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>The chances of obtaining loot from Grassy Plains monsters are increased by 75%.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Greedy Perceptors</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>These bonuses increase the amount of loot obtained from Perceptors.

They allow players to gain more experience and increase their chances of obtaining loot. Monsters can have up to 10 stars at a time, at a rate of 1 star every 10 hours.</p> \n<p>Star bonuses reduce the amount of waiting time between two stars: when they are active, players will need to wait between 5 and 15 minutes (according to the power of the bonus) to see another star appear.</p> \n<p>These bonuses apply to all creatures present in an area.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>Stars will appear on monster groups more quickly than usual in the Labyrinth of the Minotoror area: one star will appear every 5 minutes.

They do not apply to dungeons.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>An extra challenge is generated for fights against monsters in the Otomai's Ark area.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Increased challenges</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>These bonuses increase the gains obtained from completed challenges. They allow players to gain more experience points and increase their chances of dropping loot.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>Bonuses gained by completing challenges are increased by 200% in the Tynril Lab dungeon.</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Harvesting bonuses</p> \n<p></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Plenty of wood <span class='document_content2_fr-class11'>(lumberjack)</span></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Plenty of ore <span class='document_content2_fr-class11'>(miner)</span></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Plenty of fish <span class='document_content2_fr-class11'>(fisherman)</span></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Plenty of game <span class='document_content2_fr-class11'>(hunter)</span></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Plenty to harvest <span class='document_content2_fr-class11'>(farmer)</span></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Plenty to pick <span class='document_content2_fr-class11'>(alchemist)</span></p> \n<p></p> \n<p>These bonuses apply to these six professions and increase the quantities of resources obtained from harvesting.</p> \n<p>Each bonus can apply to one particular resource, several resources or all the resources linked to a particular profession.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Examples:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>The quantity of Oak Wood harvested by lumberjacks is increased by 150%.</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>The quantity of Dolomite and Obisidian harvested by miners is increased by 175%.</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'> The quantity of meat harvested by hunters of all levels is increased by 100%.</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Generation of resources</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>These bonuses reduce the time it takes for resources to appear between two harvests. They apply to five professions – hunters cannot reap the benefits. The bonuses can be limited to particular areas.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Examples:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>Fish of all types will reappear 100% more quickly than usual.</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>Resources will reappear 150% more quickly than usual in the Cania Fields area.</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Crafting bonuses</p> \n<p></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Production line</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This bonus applies to the handyman profession as well as the three food-making professions. It grants an extra chance to create a second item for each item crafted.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>For each item crafted, butchers have a 25% chance of creating a second one.</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Saved ingredients </p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This bonus grants you the chance to save some resources for each stack of ingredients used in a craft. A saved resource is not consumed.</p> \n<p>The possibility of saving resources depends on the number of resources in the given stack: the higher the resources in the stack, the higher the chance of saving an ingredient.</p> \n<p>Therefore, a bonus of 10% applied to a stack of 10 resources guarantees 1 resource saved. The same bonus applied to a stack of 5 resources would give a 50% chance of saving 1 resource.</p> \n<p>The bonus can be limited to the workshops present in a particular area.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>Harvesters and craftsmen save 15% of their ingredients when they craft items in the Lonesome Pine Trails area.</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Item quality</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>The quality of items crafted in a particular zone is increased. When an item is crafted, the bonus will be applied separately for each characteristic roll, without being able to exceed the maximum value threshold. Thus, a roll which would result in a value between 21 and 30 will increase to a value range of 23 to 30 (the bonus being calculated using the difference between the minimum and maximum values) with increased chances of obtaining a 30.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>The quality of items crafted in the city of Brakmar is increased.</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Breeding bonuses</p> \n<p></p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Dragoturkey Breeding</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>These bonuses are active on the 10th of every month. They are most commonly linked to a particular colour. Dragoturkeys of this colour that give birth on that day will produce an extra offspring.</p> \n<p>All Dragoturkeys of the colour stated will benefit from this advantage, whether they're single-coloured or double-coloured species.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Example:</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>All varieties of Golden Dragoturkey will give birth to one extra baby.</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Special bonuses</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>These bonuses are often associated with holidays. They can concern kamas, archmonsters, mounts, Kolossokens, resource protectors... They can even introduce NPCs who propose blessings for adventurers.</p> \n<p>They can also take the form of surprise items added to monster loot.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Examples:</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Our Miss Triste blessing</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>Our Miss Triste is waiting by the fountain in Amakna Village to give adventurers ugly-overs. Her blessing will transform you into a Crocodyl (a temporary effect which will disappear when you enter a fight) and leave you Butt Ugly (bonus of50 Power and 10 fixed damage for 15 fights).</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p>Devout Dragoturkeys</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>Bonuses awarded by Dragoturkey mounts are increased by 100%.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Surprise gifts</p> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class11'>Trikortritt Surprises have been added to monster loot. When you use one, you'll either receive an Al Howin's Treat or be turned into a Little Borbkin.</p> \n<pagefeed/> \n<p class='document_content2_fr-class13'>Repeatable quest</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>These special quest bonuses can only be completed for one day.

Very fond indeed. Ever the perfectionist, he even crafted an artificial heart to go inside. Fleaster came and went.

If you're the kind of person who likes to party all year round, then you'll love my new compendium!

Throw some shapes on the dancefloor and show the god Xelor you can stick to the beat! And... one two three, one two three...</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If you don't know how to dance, don't worry! You can always console yourself with a Thwee Kings Cake. This delicious, Cawwot-based pastry is traditionally eaten on Javian 6th. Legend has it that long ago, three wise Wabbits went in search of new lands, and were lost at sea for ten long years. Running desperately low on supplies, they decided to make a cake with the last few Cawwots in their sacks, but the vegetables had gone off! The first bite broke the poor Wabbits' teeth, which is why it has been customary to hide a Wabbit tooth in the cake ever since!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Flovor</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In Flovor there's still a real chill in the air, and if it doesn't kill you, it'll certainly make you stronger! Well, that's what the disciples of the goddess Sacrier like to tell themselves, anyway. If you want to see just how accurate their proverb is, visit the Flovor Bawl on the first of the month and find out for yourself!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If you'd rather warm yourself up with a banquet than with a Bawl, then Stove Yumday on Flovor 2nd is not to be missed! This ancient tradition, hailing from the Amaknian countryside, is a simple one: make a huge pile of pancakes, and then give them all to a Gobball. If it eats them all, it's a sign that spring is about to arrive. If not, it's probably because your batter has gone off... or that the obese ovine has already eaten!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Be careful not to overdo it, though, because there's another feast to come! Flovor 14th is Ballotwine's Day, when star-cross'd lovers send each other chocolates. And if you count your suitors by the dozen (like the charming Louse Degraine), you'll pile on the kilopods faster than you can blink. You'll end up with nothing but a big belly for your trouble - and gods help you if you clock those delicious doughnuts at the Too Faux Karnaval as well...</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, every four years, you can take part in the world-renowned Krozolympik Games. Flovor 29th is the perfect opportunity for you and your fellow competitors to get your hearts thumping and legs pumping, and to burn off a few calories while you're at it!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Martalo</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>In Martalo, the rain keeps pouring - and so does the drink! Saint Potrick's Day falls on the 17th of the month, and venerates the goddess Pandawa and her love of bamboo milk. It's not unusual to see other classes joining her disciples for an all-day (and all-night!) party - the Eniripsa Pinta Gone is a regular. Every year, he dresses in green and takes part in all the drinking competitions, even imbibing the infamous Grinness, a drink made from macerated clover. Needless to say, many people end the night in a very sorry state. When the participants start to look a little green around the gills, it's customary to wish them a happy Saint Potrick's Day before helping them into bed.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>St. Potrick's Day also marks the beginning of spring, with birds chirping in the trees and flowers springing up in the fields. It's no surprise that after such a drunken evening, it's customary to deposit some natural fertiliser on your neighbours' flower beds. But be careful; it may be a generous gesture, but it's not to everyone's taste...</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Aperirel</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>On the first of Aperirel, zany pranksters try to stick Snappers on your back without you noticing. This may sound like harmless fun - but nothing could be further from the truth! A source of bitter dispute (‘You know where you can stick your Snapper, you old cod!'), and salacious scandals, this tradition can cause the unwary all sorts of trouble! Take Magus Ax, for example. He had a Gudgeon stuck to his cape for two weeks, and the wise old sage's reputation has never recovered from the accusations of dubious personal hygiene. So, a word to the wise: prudence.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of personal hygiene, I remember one particularly rainy Aperirel when Don Rouann, a playboy by profession, was caught naked in the Amakna Village fountain with only a young lady and her blushes for company. There's an old saying; “Aperirel showers bring Maysial flowers”, but in Don's case, those showers brought him nothing but trouble - a terrible bout of pneumonia! Rushed urgently to the nearby Temple of Eniripsa, he was unable to take part in any of the Fleaster festivities.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>The Fleaster egg hunt is a much-loved tradition in the World of Twelve, and usually takes place in the gardens of Amakna Castle. They say that one year, King Allister hid a golden Dofus amongst the traditional Fleaster eggs. No one knew if this story was true, or just a legend, but suffice it to say that plenty of Srams, Rogues and Enutrofs took part that year!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Speaking of Enutrofs, Aperirel is the month of the Fabrikamation, the day when they pay homage to their god. More often than not they'll send a little prayer his way, asking him to bring them luck, but they certainly won't get carried away. As well you know, Enutrofs are particularly stingy with their time, because time, after all, is money!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Maysial</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Fairy Lax spent her days blowing herself up so that other people could have some fun, but one Maysial she decided she'd had enough. She fancied a holiday, and so she went on strike, managing to convince all of her Fairy colleagues to do the same. In memory of their struggle, it was decided that the first of Maysial should become a bank holiday, so this month, why don't you kick back, relax and enjoy yourself?</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>A week later is the Maysial Munch - goodbye scrapping, hello scoffing! This celebration, in honour of the god Iop, is the perfect opportunity to make peace with your enemies by inviting them to share a delightful eight-course meal at your table! A friendly and peaceful occasion... until dessert, at least - because once the eight courses are gone, the plates are sure to fly!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Anyone unlucky enough to be injured by this cascade of crockery can get their treatment for free on Healy Thursday. This celebration, honouring Rosal, protector of the month of Maysial, invites healers to volunteer their services for the good of their peers. The Eniripsas are going to have their work cut out!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If scoffing, scrapping and throwing plates isn't really your thing, why not head over to the Super Gobbowl and soak up some of the atmosphere (and celebrate the team spirit!). This event, which takes place on Maysial 15th, is the sporting event of the year, and is not to be missed!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Junssidor</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Ah, it's Junssidor at last, when everyone heads outside to enjoy the sunshine and get some much-needed fresh air. If you like gardening, and prefer your vegetables organic and straight out of your garden, Plantalot Monday is the day for you! If you'd prefer a picnic, or a quiet walk through a beautiful, blooming garden, try the Guardian Party instead, which takes place on the 4th!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>But the event of the month is undoubtedly Gobbstock! On the 21st, musicians across the World of Twelve will fill your heart with joy! This event is the perfect opportunity to dust off your flute or your zither, and organise an impromptu concert with your friends! Who can forget Jon Lemon's concert in the Bonta Arena? The ageing crooner performed some of his greatest hits, ‘A Migraine' and ‘Jailhouse Guy' being particularly well received.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Take my advice and make sure Yo Kohono isn't on the bill, though, or the concert might end earlier than expected!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Jullier</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If you were born on the 4th of Jullier, like Tom Crust, then you're going to love Ultra Super Amakna! Originally organised by the famous Captain of the same name, this super event showcases everything that's super about the super city of Amakna. Super! So strap on your red, white and blue shields and dive right in!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>But if patriotism isn't your cup of tea, then maybe Jullier 14th is for you! On this day, a handful of revolutionary peasants commemorate the day of the Taking of the Pastille, a tragic episode where King Allister, suffering from a sore throat, nearly choked to death on a cough sweet, which would have led to the collapse of our beautiful monarchy! Every year on this date, rebellious opponents of the current regime throw Fairyworks from the castle walls to celebrate this symbolic event. Don't be surprised if you see the royal guard wandering through the fields!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>If you're looking to unwind and enjoy a moment of tenderness with your pet, then the Society for Partying and Caring for Animals' festival, held on Jullier 23rd, should be right up your street! It was created to honour the God Osamodas, and also to give thanks to the devoted owners of Bow Meows, Bow Wows and other domesticated beasts for their kindness towards their loyal companions. Make sure you pack your wellington boots though, as some of the animals can get a little over-zealous when marking their territory!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>And finally, to close this summer month in suitable fashion, take a trip to the Trool Fair on Jullier 30th, when we celebrate the anniversary of its founding. With Gladiatrool fights to sate your bloodlust and Trool burgers to sate your hunger, there's something for everyone on Trool Day!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Frauguctor</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Head north to the City of Angels on Frauguctor 3rd, where the great Festival of Bonta will take place! Take part in peaceful demonstrations to prove to your friends that the world is a kind, caring place, not forgetting to randomly hug strangers in the street...</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>But if you'd prefer to unwind on a deserted beach with only shellfish and crustaceans for company, then no problem! Frauguctor 15th is the Star Lazing festival, the perfect opportunity to spend all day snoozing beneath the red-hot sun and topping up your tan. And at night, after a good long nap, let the festivities begin! Fairyworks light up the sky, sparkling and shimmering like the stars - and the best part is, you don't even have to get up off your sun lounger to watch!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Septangel</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If Septangel's longer nights and shorter days are getting you down, there's only one thing to do: take part in the festivities of Konval Essence Day! With all the celebrations planned in honour of the goddess Eniripsa, you're bound to find your maudlin mood is lifted!</p>\n\n<p>Especially given that on the 12th, you're likely to need something to pick you up again: on the anniversary of the Crimson Dawn, the atmosphere is far from jovial. Be careful, because the day which commemorates the terrible battle between Bonta and Brakmar is often the opportunity for simmering feuds to spark and for old wounds to be reopened. Prudence, once again, is the watchword.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, the festivities of the following week should lift your spirits a little. Every 19th Septangel, the pirate Seth Halitosis organises a special event: the Me Hearty Party. The famous filibuster promotes the use of pirate lingo and more... how can I put this... florid expressions. So if you love Greedo Rum and have a potty mouth that'd make a Brakmarian trooper blush, fill your boots!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Octolliard</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The goddess Cra is the focus of attention during the month of Octolliard, and on the 3rd (All Arrows Eve), there's an archery competition. It was created at the behest of a man named Bill Tell, and if, like him, you have the soul of an archer, why don't you try your luck?</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Or maybe you'd prefer to go adventuring through strange new lands, in which case wait for the 12th and Bamboozle Day! Take a small detour to see Charlie's Agents and hey presto! You're ready to play at being an explorer, just like Kris Tofcolon!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Octolliard is also the month when Chafers come crawling out of the closet, and Al Howin's Gobballs make their appearance - watch out for the latter, because they're definitely more ‘lick then eat!' than ‘trick or treat!'. The only way to escape their curse is to wear a hat carved from a Pumpkwin. Here's a tip: stock up next time you're at the grocer's!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If you've not had your fill of vegetables, then I'm sure you'll have room for a slice of roast Dragoturkey to celebrate the festival of Hank Skivin. Unless you're a follower of Skank Hivin instead, in which case you'll have to wait until the following month!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Novamaire</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The beautiful month of Novamaire begins, aptly enough, with Captain Chafer's Panty Party! Every year, in tribute to this mysterious, long-lost Chafer, people dress up in tight leather panties and dance a feverish tango by the light of numerous Fairyworks. This is a prestigious event, and guests are hand-picked for the occasion! Ztiv Oztin and Setsinbol, for example, are regulars, but don't expect to spot them - this is a masked ball, after all, to ensure the safety of the celebrities taking part. With their identities hidden, they can let their hair down and throw some shapes on the dancefloor in total anonymity.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If the idea of hanging out in your pants doesn't really tempt you (maybe you're shy, or have a few too many hang-ups about your body), you can console yourself on Novamaire 11th, when it's Our Miss Triste's Day. This is the date of the World of Twelve's largest ‘who is the ugliest?' competition, and a simple glance at the participants will have you feeling much more attractive!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>But that isn't the only day when you might come across some rather unsavoury characters, because on the 15th, it's the Night of the Bandeads! The meanest of the god Sram's disciples, thieves, scoundrels, faithless rogues and lawless Srams are on the prowl, so keep your wallet, your hands and anything else that isn't tied down in your pockets and pray!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>And finally, if you didn't celebrate Hank Skivin in Octolliard, you can celebrate the festival of Skank Hivin this month instead. Custom dictates that adventurers should gather around a stuffed Dragoturkey and share a good meal together - after all, as the saying goes: 'In Novamaire, Dragoturkeys beware!'</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p class='document_content2_fr-class7'>Descendre</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>If the streets seem unusually quiet on the 6th Descendre, it's because all the children are inside, trembling in their beds, for the day is Father Whupper Day! This infamous miscreant punishes any child who has been naughty rather than nice - which has the Brakmarian populace trembling most of all!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>On the 12th, it's the Bontarians' turn to worry, because it's the day of the Brakmarathon - the official festival of Brakmar. Drunkenness, debauchery and lewd behaviour are the order of the day, and opportunities for malicious mischief-making are legion!</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Fortunately the atmosphere is a little more relaxed during the rest of the month. The 18th is Play Day, a day devoted to Ecaflip, when devilish dares and crazy challenges abound. There's nothing like a good game of dice or a risky bet for warming the blood!</p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>But most of all, Descendre is all about Kwismas! As well as the traditional pilgrimage to the island of the same name, the most common tradition falls on the day of the 25th, when adventurers decorate their Kwismas Itztings with beautiful garlands, and enjoy a meal of Dragoturkey and chestnut stuffing with their friends. Indigestion ahoy!</p>","contentCSS":"li {\r\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\r\n}\r\nbody {\r\n\tcolor: #000000;\r\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\r\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\r\n\tfont-style: normal;\r\n\tfont-weight: normal;\r\n\tlist-style-type: none;\r\n\ttext-align: justify;\r\n\ttext-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\na {\r\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\r\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\np {\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\r\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\r\n}\r\n.document_content2_fr-class13 {\r\n\tfont-style: italic;\r\n\tfont-weight: bold;\r\n}\r\n.document_content2_fr-class12 {\r\n\tfont-weight: bold;\r\n}\r\n.document_content2_fr-class11 {\r\n\tfont-style: italic;\r\n}\r\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\r\n\tfont-size: 20pt;\r\n\tfont-weight: bold;\r\n}\r\nol {\r\n\tlist-style-type: square;\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\r\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\r\n}\r\n"},"363":{"id":363,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Ripped Travel Journal","authorId":"Wabewt Scoot","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p>There are only a few scraps left of the entries Wabewt Scoot made in his travel journal.

That's just what I asked him. \"I thought it would be a good story to tell in the pub later,\" he replied. \"And I wanted an inheritance worthy of a lady-killer as charismatic as I am.\" I'll never forget the way he grinned throughout the light-hearted confession, and how his eyes twinkled at the word 'lady-killer'. I may never know whether the whole story was a joke in bad taste or a fleeting window into the thoughts and doings of a callous breaker of perfectly good hearts and boats.</p> <pagefeed/> <p>The Marquis has never shied away from dubious practices, and has never seen Good and Evil as guidelines on how to behave. He regards all emotions as equal in worth - happiness, sadness, scorn... They don't really matter, as long as the actions that caused them were worth it. He's a staunch fan of chaos; in fact, I'd be prepared to go as far as to say that our friend the Marquis has, his whole life long, suffered from an intense phobia of all that is dull. Terrified by the prospect of spending a single second of his life without something new and interesting to do, he'll tell anyone who'll listen all about his stance on 'leading a full and eventful life'. I firmly believe that he'd give Death himself a wedgie given the chance: for him, the opposite of life is boredom.</p> <pagefeed/> <p>I know nothing of his childhood, although sometimes I wonder if he's ever grown up at all. His temperament is certainly that of a middle-aged man, characterised by a deep-rooted self-possession and a faultless nobility, and yet his mind is like a child's, jittering to and fro in perpetual motion. Nobody has ever channeled his energy, and nobody will ever force him to settle into a life of monotony; of that much I am sure. Should you ever meet this individual, hope and pray that you do not become the centre of his (malevolent) attention. This is a man who infiltrated a pirate bastion and set fire to all the gunpowder reserves before he was out of his pyjamas one morning. Just imagine what such a man could do to you! I learnt this the hard way, the day he decided to prove that a disciple of Sadida would have more fun capering around than taking naps. The singed hairs on my rump still haven't grown back! Curse you, Marquis of Lhambadda!</p>","contentCSS":"li {\r\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\r\n}\r\nbody {\r\n\tcolor: #000000;\r\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\r\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\r\n\tfont-style: normal;\r\n\tfont-weight: normal;\r\n\tlist-style-type: none;\r\n\ttext-align: justify;\r\n\ttext-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\na {\r\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\r\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\np {\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\r\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\r\n}\r\nol {\r\n\tlist-style-type: square;\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\r\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\r\n}\r\n"},"376":{"id":376,"typeId":1,"titleId":"How the Marquis and Shariva Became Acquainted","authorId":"The Marquis of Lhambadda","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p>The Rogues left early on, taking with them their part of the spoils.</p> <p></p> <p>The heist at Astrub bank went without a hitch. Of course, the Marquis insisted on sharing the stolen money between two passers-by, not keeping a single kama for himself - but such is his way.</p> <p></p> <p>The Marquis had never sought to live luxuriously, never been drawn into the tireless quest for gold, never been known to go a little gaga for jewels or stately homes, and never been motivated in any way by material possessions. In fact, whenever he found himself with a cargo of illegitimately obtained kamas, he was quite unable to imagine spending them on anything at all. His sole pleasure and aim in life was to turn the humdrum of daily life on its head. So you can be sure that, when his cheeks flushed and his eyes twinkled as he looked back on the robbery, it was not the glint of coins that set his heart racing, but the memory of throwing the town into disorder, the adrenaline rush, the thrill of the unexpected, and the hilarious image of the bankers' tail-feathers dropping in fright from under their tousled uniforms. He had scooped up these same feathers as a souvenir, by the by, and has since stuffed them into his sofa to give it extra bounce.</p> <pagefeed/> <p>Once the euphoria had subsided, it didn't take long for our little rabble-rouser to kick himself as he thought back on the swag he had so gaily distributed, and this led him to an interesting realisation. \"Am I in my right mind, sharing my loot between two strangers? Surely I would have been better off throwing it on the ground between the two, so I could sit scoffing cashews and enjoying the show as they ripped one another to shreds for the prize!\"</p> <p></p> <p>The Marquis swore there and then never to let such a chance slip away again. Rather than playing the diamond in the rough, he would always opt for the path of maximum destruction.<p> <pagefeed/> <p>One evening, he was relaxing in the cool waters of Astrub Lake, feeling debonair and running over the events of the day in his mind, just as he did every evening. This was the paradox of his life: in constantly seeking new ways to beat boredom, he was settling into a new kind of monotony! However, this was not the thought on the good Marquis's mind that night. No, all he could think about as he gazed up at the starry vault was a question he had thus far never voiced out loud:</p> <p></p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>\"For ten long years now, every day,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>In all I do and all I say,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Where'er I go, whome'er I see,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>I've pledged myself to novelty.</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Far beyond the city's walls,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>I've erred to answer nature's calls;</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>I've started fires, and scenes, and fights,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Brought danger to my days and nights...</p> <pagefeed/> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>From every ruse, I walk scot-free,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>So now I ask: How can that be?</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>The gods above can see my crimes,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>I must have sinned a thousand times,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Am I exempt from accusation...?</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>This can't be my imagination.</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Gods, though this may sound conceited,</p> <p class='document_content2_fr-class5'>Why is it that I'm undefeated?\"</p> <pagefeed/> <p>This monologue, and the heavy silence which followed, had an unprecedented effect on the Marquis in that he suddenly felt uncharacteristically humble and contrite. Undefeated... Chosen by the gods, indeed! What a thought! Next I shall announce that I am immortal... And what if someone was to overhear? He was known far and wide for his devil-may-care attitude... What would an eavesdropper think of this helpless plea to the gods above?</p> <p>To this day, nobody knows whether there was anyone crouching in the undergrowth to hear this speech and to witness the fateful encounter that ensued. The Marquis had just let out a long sigh, rolled up his scroll and decided to go home, when a tiny bubble rushed to the surface of the lake... followed by another, then another. Seeing this, the Marquis burst into an incomprehensible babble of prayers; the following instant, the sky over Astrub turned to black in a flash. The lake, usually troubled by no more than the comings and goings of curious fish, was whipped into a violent typhoon. In a matter of seconds, the quiet scene had become a whirlwind of agitation, from the depths of which there rose what was, unmistakably, a goddess of bad intent.

It was not until later, when Shariva, who had started calling herself the goddess of Tumult, appeared again that the two decided to work together. Now, the mischievous pair certainly cut a fine figure, and the Marquis was over the moon to have acquired Shariva's divine protection as he carried out all his devilish pranks to ward off the heavy fog of boredom. The goddess, however, soon became restless. Granted, her first disciple was a relentless propagandist who won her many allies, but \"Tumultu-Us\", as the partisans of the cause liked to call themselves, remained a sparse and hopelessly disorganised collective. Each faction held its own events in its own region, robbing, killing, hunting, wreaking havoc, running amok, playing, writing and generally contributing to the spirit of raucous misbehaviour... but only for a certain time, before the members one by one thought better of their ways and turned back to their gods, praying for long hours and asking forgiveness.<p> <pagefeed/> <p>Shariva's cult seemed to have reached the point of no return. The goddess of Perpetual Change's disciples were spending more and more time currying favour with people in high places in the hope of succeeding in their personal endeavours. Fewer and fewer people were devoted to the New World Disorder - the name given to the manifesto and philosophy by which the cult had hoped to turn Terra Amakna into a place of constant activity and excitement. With great sadness, Lady Shambles realised that she was going to have to take her retirement - for a time, at least. She was not, however, about to abandon her followers. Far from it. She was just changing her game plan. One night, she appeared to the Marquis to share her theory: although the members of Tumultu-Us were exceptionally useful in their own way, and although their nightly prayers provided enough mischievous energy to keep the goddess's schemes ticking over, wouldn't involving outside groups, whose members would not answer to her beck and call, enable them to start making a real impact?</p> <pagefeed/> <p>The Marquis, lapping up the goddess's words as usual, agreed with enthusiasm and promptly tasked himself with finding all the individuals who, despite worshipping other gods, had proven themselves worthy by their acts. Without even knowing about Shariva, they had, in some way or another, contributed to the New World Disorder. The Marquis was to be in charge of this league of \"trouble-makers\"; Shariva would observe from the sidelines, only intervening for special occasions.

All good things come to an end, it's true. But just a few more days away from the city and its gloomy weather would have been nice!</p><br/>\n\n\n<p>Events rarely stir up the ambient calm in the\nMilicluster. So, I felt real apprehension early this morning when, shortly before my shift was scheduled to start, I saw a procession (more like a herd) of guards and soldiers bustling about on the edge of the city. It was cool out and the morning dew was still clinging weakly to the high grass – yet another reason to miss the comforting heat of the seaside. </p><br/>\n\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Yet, the temperature didn't seem to bother the curious crowd around what seemed at first to be a strange flat, dry patch. Some of the inhabitants, still in their nightclothes or wrapped in thick shawls, were leaning toward whatever everyone was staring at, asking those nearest them questions.</p><br/>\n\n\n<p>Curious and troubled, I too moved closer to the crowd, and that's when I discovered to my stupefaction what seemed to be a bottomless pit.</p><br/>\n\n\n<p>A large crack, big enough to contain a small home entirely in its embrace, was spread across a patch of hot, rocky ground. The fresh grass and white flowers that are so common in the region were gone, replaced by dry, brown dirt. </p><br/>\n\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Thick reddish vapors giving off an indescribable odor were pouring steadily out of the steaming crevasse. The cold, the cool air, and the morning dew stopped there, at the doors of this strange gash.</p><br/>\n\n\n<p>Above the murmuring, a louder rumor was soon spreading rapidly among the crowd of villagers. They were milling around, agitated, asking and answering questions.\nJust as it reached its peak, the agitation suddenly stopped like a candle being blown out. A dull sound, a rough cry, like a heavy wail, echoed from the bottom of the rift, demanding silence. My entire body tightened, and a glacial shiver ran up my spine. A long, weighty silence followed by a relentless wait forced itself on us. Had that really been a cry?</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>The tension was palpable and I could feel it spread through the crowd as people exchanged glances. Terrified, worried or excited looks were exchanged in silence, as if to make sure that everyone had indeed heard, imagined or guessed the source of the cry.\nAnd just then, slithering and whimpering, a worm or huge larva was climbing, nearly rippling, to the surface of the rift. Its smooth and shiny skin was a shocking contrast with the dark edges of the earthen rift. I saw a giant insect, whose carapace seemed to have cracked loudly and painfully under the assault of some giant's boot.</p><br/>\n\n\n<p>A second cry sounded out and a second worm appeared in the reddish mist. Panic set in, and I tried in vain to push back the thick crowd around the dreadful beast climbing ever higher, accompanied in the distance by an entire host of its peers.</p><br/>\n\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>It wasn't long before the entire Amakna militia was called in to help and secure the edges of the rift.</p> <br/>\n\n<p>Me, I spent the rest of the afternoon watching an adventurer escort a certain Sedierta Otel through the arid zone infested by the beasts. A renowned scientist, the tall brunette spent most of her time studying particles of sand left behind by the worms in their clumsy movements and the steaming worm carcasses left behind by the soldiers.</p><br/>\n\n\n<p>The most intriguing part of the story for me (other than the clearly impossible task of counting the teeth on some of the worms' jaws!) is the unbelievable source of these beasts. They apparently come from the deserts and most arid areas of this world, but how did these strange creatures find a way to dig through the ground all the way to Amakna's doors and cause such an uproar in our humble land? </p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Junssidor 26</p><br/><br/>\n\n<p>A loud noise (commotion, more like!) stirred me from my dreams this morning. The gentle wind this fine morning was an early sign of the warm season, fast approaching. I took advantage of the breeze to go for a stroll. Truth be told, the last few weeks haven't been a picnic for this soldier!</p><br/>\n\n<p>First it was that strange chasm and the filthy, grotesque worms that spilled out, terrifying the entire Milicluster and then several nations on the continent. Even today, members of my own garrison are tasked with securing the area and (ceaselessly) repelling the foul creatures from the depths.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Then there was the curious round house that had seemingly tumbled down from the highlands of Cania. That mysterious cabin made of grass, wood and stone actually became everyone's main source of concern. The house, sure... but also the unfortunate little character, no doubt taken aback by his home suddenly plummeting, found buried and crushed beneath the debris. </p><br/>\n\n<p>This gave rise to a flood of questions and theories, some less credible than others, and interest in the uncharted hills of Cania has only grown. Some adventurers tried finding a way up to the higher plateaus, but the only path they could uncover was blocked by a massive stone, and I don't think it's liable to budge.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>My walk this morning brought me to the ruins of that small structure, across from the stretch of liquid that appeared when the rubble did. A small waterfall has since flowed from the heights of Cania into the thick puddle. I wondered to myself if this strange new brook might be what produced the fallen rock. Suddenly, a loud noise rang out across the valley.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Briefly stunned, I looked around in every direction possible to find out where this racket came from. I spotted smoke in the distance and bolted toward it. Having reached the source of the smoke, I realized it was in fact a dense cloud of dust. All around me, what had happened with the Milicluster was repeating itself. Much of the Cania mountain had caved in, leaving an impressive rift in the ground. I could already imagine creepy things skittering up its walls. That's where my leisurely stroll ended.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p> Jullier 18</p><br/><br/>\n\n\t<p>A Stubbyob once told me: \"Living on Mount Neselite is nice, once we stop thinking about all the bad things that happen out of the blue!\" Honestly, I'm starting to believe him. Yes, yes... Wait for me to recap the latest happenings for you. I seem to have lost a few pages. If you're a Twelvian (or any similar race), you've probably heard of the Stubbyobs and their village built up on the heights of Cania, known as Mount Neselite.</p><br/>\n\n<p>As it happens, the collapse that occurred a few weeks ago indeed created a fresh rift in the ground. The militia rushed over just as the first worms started to rear their... very, very ugly heads. </p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Although we were initially overwhelmed with fear, our terror was soon replaced by a strong sense of curiosity. Beneath the strange crack (now splitting the rocks of Cania in two, like a box of snappers ripped open), we discovered a whole little world completely hidden away. </p><br/>\n\n<p>Perched atop the highest point of Cania, the Stubbyobs of the Hard-Head clan live (mostly) in peace in their funny rounded homes. These diminutive humanoids love beer, crafting, and waging war; they hate salad, thieves, and the opposing tribe of Stubbyobs: the Freezammer clan. Stubbyobs wield magic just as well as their hammers, axes, and anvils. </p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Given the Stubbyobs' fiery temperament, we quickly realized it was best not to cause them any trouble. They've got enough trouble as it is. First they were exiled, decades past, from their precious Undersmithy constructed deep in the mountain, forcing them to settle on the hills of Cania instead of inside them; many Stubbyobs are nostalgic for that time. What's more, it's because of a complex mechanism located in the heart of the mountain that their dam, built above the village, is threatening the clan's safety. </p><br/>\n\n<p>Then there was the recent cave-in, which resulted in the theft of their \"very precious ore\". Don't ask... It's apparently \"very, very precious\". Since the avalanche revealed their existence to the world, the Stubbyobs have been quite wary of Twelvians. They accuse us, by turns, of stealing their ore, enlarging their doors when we enter their homes, and finally, not respecting the local customs for how to properly drink a beer.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Thankfully, a few of the Stubbyobs are prepared to negotiate with us, happy to secure some aid from the Twelvians. I'll let the adventurers deal with all that. As for me, I'm taking advantage of the Stubbyobs' mastery of beer. Doubledry Ale, made by the Zeesmithy house, is delightful, though some will call you a heretic and go on about how Grinness, from the Grodunk family, is the only beer worth drinking!

As dry as sand, it left the taste of metal and ash in the mouths of the soldiers crowding the ramparts. Coughing and spitting, Astrubians tried to catch their breath. Ratathrosk and the Autumn Knight were down, surrounded by assailing troops. Was the battle lost?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Queen Tressa rode forward on her ram with its impressive horns. The fog didn't seem to bother her: like the Crocodyls, she was used to breathing the noxious swamp vapours. She raised her rune-engraved hammer and loudly addressed her troops.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\"The Seven are watching us, sons and daughters of the mountains! It is time for us to show them that the blood that runs in our veins is not made of mud, but of red copper as fiery as the coals of a blast furnace! We are the children of the Smith. Nothing can break us. Today, I will overthrow an empire. Are you with me?\"</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The Stubbyobs roared and pounded the ground with their lead soles. It didn't matter that the Crocodyls were greater in number: the ginger-bearded warriors were determined to send them back to the mire from whence they came, the mire they never should have left.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The artillery lit the wicks on their cast-iron cannons. Iron and fire rained down on the scaly ones, mowing them down like stalks of wheat at harvest time. The acrid odour of burnt flesh mingled with the smell of gunpowder; the smoke thickened the veil that covered the battlefield like a shroud over the bodies of the dying.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Crocodyls fell back, throwing javelins with barbed spikes. Despite their armour no arrow could pierce, the Stubbyobs fell, victims of the acid able to eat through the thickest breastplates.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Trusting the protection his grithril hauberk provided him, General Flaxen-Mane charged without the slightest hint of hesitation; in his wake, the knights spurred their armoured Gobballs and bore down on the enemy. The lizards tried to withstand the Stubbyobs' attack, but they were stomped on, chopped to smithereens, sliced thin and reduced to mush under the weight of the studded maces. Panic filled their reptilian brains. Were they all going to die in the shadow of Astrub's walls?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>On top of the ramparts, the mercenaries felt hope return. Determined to fight for their city, they headed down to the gates to attempt a sally. The city might not fall after all... Their long-bearded allies wouldn't let it!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>On the top of a hill, the Jade Bloodlord watched the battle from his carriage mounted on the back of a mastodon with oversized tusks. Noting that his subjects were losing the advantage, he brandished the sword that had made him the uncontested master of the Crocodyls. The green blade shone with lightning. Its flashing bolts struck the Stubbyobs, blackening their breastplates in bursts of evil-coloured sparks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>General Flaxen-Mane screamed with rage and frustration when the evil fire hit him straight on. The old soldier fell to the ground, a grimace distorting his scarred face. His heart beat one last time then stopped. It was as good a day to die as any other... His eyes turned to his queen before closing forever.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Tressa fought against the wave of sadness that threatened to drown her. Her most loyal supporter had just left her. She prayed that his soul would join his ancestors in the eternal forges. The words of an ancient war song running through her mind, she raised her shield bearing the emblems of the Yerg clan. It was time for her adversaries to feel the full weight of her wrath... the wrath of a queen.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tressa spun her hammer. The weapon crushed the skulls of the Crocodyls too stupid or too foolhardy to move out of the way. The royal ram rushed towards the hill. However could it hope to rival the imperial mastodon that towered above it? It looked like a Moumouse charging a Mufafah... but nothing seemed capable of stopping it.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The scaly ones who attempted to stand in the way were scattered like tufts of straw. The queen shouted the names of the gods protecting her people. Benjak, Tasmalin, Icleen! Pasqueoz, Ediva, Eruvel! Pierrock! They were all with her, of that Tressa had no doubt.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The emperor growled and snapped his long jaws. He pointed his sword at the queen of the Stubbyobs.</p>\n<p>Two lightning bolts ripped through the fog. The first caused sparks to fly from the surface of the shield in the clan's colours. The second set the Gobball's thick fleece on fire. The animal didn't slow: it didn't feel the pain. It was one with its mistress, and would take her to the end of her road, no matter what it cost.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Jade Bloodlord invoked the power of lightning again. And again. And again. And yet again.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The ram eventually fell before the mastodon. Its body was no more than smoking ash.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The queen rose. Coals crackled in her ruby hair. She screamed in rage, then struck the ground with her hammer, ignoring the massive feet of the monster threatening to crush her. A crack appeared. With a deafening crack, the crevasse widened. The mastodon lost its balance; its giant body tipped over, swallowed up by the earth opening at its feet like the jaws of a starving Boowolf.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The emperor jumped off to avoid being swallowed by the crevasse. He landed heavily in front of Tressa, who lifted her hammer again.</p>\n<p>The Bloodlord avoided a blow strong enough to break an anvil.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Tressa pressed her opponent with attack after attack. The emperor stayed on the defensive, watching carefully for the opportunity to strike back, like a snake staring at its prey with cold eyes. Unlike the queen of the Stubbyobs, he wasn't consumed by anger. His actions were driven solely by his thirst for power; emotions had no sway over him.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The Crocodyls and Stubbyobs were holding their breath all around the two monarchs fighting to the death, as if transfixed by the scene. Behind the large portcullis of the Astrub gate, the mercenaries had gathered, waiting for their captain's signal to launch a counterattack against the enemy army. Posted on the ramparts, their leader couldn't tear his eyes away from the two figures fighting on the top of the hill shrouded in mist. The outcome of the battle – and most likely the war itself – would depend on this fight.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Tressa continued her attack, untiringly. Her hammer finally hit its target: it crashed forcefully into the spiky breastplate the emperor was wearing. The Bloodlord let out a puff when his bones broke; he ignored the pain and grabbed the handle of the heavy, rune-engraved mass with a clawed hand, preventing the queen from moving away. The jade sword swung in a bloody arc and cut deeply into Tressa's thigh. She let go to avoid a second attack. She staggered, feeling the venom from the blade burn her flesh. The Crocodyls had broken every rule of warfare since they set out to conquer the World of Twelve. It was no surprise, then, that their emperor had used poison – the weapon of cowards – to accomplish his goal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Seeing their queen in difficulty, the Stubbyobs rushed to her aid. They were struck by the crackling fire invoked by the emperor.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>Tressa struggled to stay standing. She raised her shield to protect herself from the lightning, and unhooked her axe from her belt. The Bloodlord turned slowly around his enemy, staying at a cautious distance. Victory was near... The queen was on her knees. With a cry of despair, she threw her axe. It spun and narrowly missed the crowned head of the emperor before planting itself in the chest of a scaly one who fell with a groan of agony.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The queen of the Stubbyobs was now weaponless. The master of the Crocodyls approached slowly. He raised the hammer he had taken from the queen and brought it down on Tressa's shield several times until her shield shattered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bloodlord smiled cruelly. He tossed aside the hammer and took up his two-handed sword, ready to deliver the fatal blow.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>The green blade was stopped in its tracks by another blade. An indistinct silhouette had suddenly appeared near the queen, like a ghost appearing out of nowhere. The emperor took a step back; he eventually identified the ghostly form, recognising the helm adorned with the crest of the Autumn Knight. He had killed the champion with his own hands. What was this sorcery?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The mist thickened. A growl not unlike an thunder shook the ground on the hill. The mercenaries, Stubbyobs and Crocodyls felt a supernatural fear seize their hearts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Night fell on the battlefield. A night carried by two membranous wings, each flap of which filled the sky like thousands of cymbals sounding out in unison.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Bloodlord looked up. The dragon Protector of Astrub had returned to keep its promise.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\r\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\r\n}\r\nbody {\r\n\tcolor: #000000;\r\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\r\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\r\n\tfont-style: normal;\r\n\tfont-weight: normal;\r\n\tlist-style-type: none;\r\n\ttext-align: justify;\r\n\ttext-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\n.document_content2_es-class6 {\r\n\tfont-weight: bold;\r\n}\r\na {\r\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\r\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\np {\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\r\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\r\n}\r\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\r\n\tfont-weight: bold;\r\n}\r\nol {\r\n\tlist-style-type: square;\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\r\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\r\n}\r\n"},"389":{"id":389,"typeId":2,"titleId":"The Seven Clans","authorId":"","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p>...And the Smith gave birth to the First by striking the anvil of the gods.

Rulers of the underground world, we mine the rock to extract metals and use them as we see fit. Our pickaxes open paths through the darkness, like light breaking through the shadows; our hammers strike the anvil to the beat of the artisans' song. Our reward? To sculpt the stone, smelt the iron, polish the gemstones to create masterpieces to pass on to our heirs. <br/><br/>\n Don't be mistaken: we are not Rotceres. We're not hiding from the abovegrounders. The fire of war burns in our veins. We do not fear anything or anyone: it is our enemies that fear us. Cave-dwelling Trools soil themselves at the very mention of our name, Bworks pale in fear, Crocodyls call for their mothers. Even dragons sleep with one eye open, because these vile creatures, bereft of honour, know that we will show them no mercy if we catch them in their lairs. </p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n\n<p> We have gone into battle again and again over the millennia. Countless goblins have perished beneath the weight of our wrath (and our hammers). Disciples of Enutrof have been unceremoniously thrown out of our mines; servants of Cra have been asked to return to their forests on pain of ending up in the lava. Some feuds between the seven clans have been settled with axes, others with brimming tankards of beer. Long we waited for our rulers to crown a master of masters, a supreme leader, a king of kings: Skori Whitebeerd was the first. Unfortunately, he was also the last... <br/><br/>\nSkori's reign had, however, started under the best auspices. It took seven days to choose between the pretenders to the grithil throne. After a brawl for the ages, the king of the Whitebeerd clan was finally chosen.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>The monarch's first task was to bring all the clans together under one banner: a thousand beers, one king. It was time to put an end to our many quarrels. The Bibles of Grudges and the Grudge Registry were purged of all existing disputes between the families. New alliances were made; pacts were sealed, beard hair was exchanged. <br/><br/>\n\nWhen Jade Bloodlord went forth to conquer the World of Twelve to spread wider the bounds of his empire, Skori rose up against him. The Hard-Heads and the Worldbeards made their stand to protect the Cania Plains; the Firebrands halted the invasion to the south of the Sidimote Moors. The Freezammers and the Whitebeerds crossed the Kantil Sea to join the troops fighting on the continent. The Stonestomachs defended the kingdom of Amakna. The Stubbyobs of the Koalak Mountains paid the heaviest price, suffering the full force of attacks from the Crocodyl legions. Queen Tressa Yerg distinguished herself during the final clash with the scaled enemy, on Astrub hill. Before the walls of the City of Mercenaries, the emperor fell, and his army was decimated. For the first time in history, the disciples of the Twelve fought at our side; our victory became legend. </p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n\n<p> Afterwards, the world changed. The Dofus brought hope for a better future, before it was stolen by a dragon. Xelor's Clock now marks the passage of time, an inescapable reminder of the weight of passing years that lie heavy on the shoulders of mortals. <br/><br/>\n\nThe cities of Bonta and Brakmar divided us. Defiance, hypocrisy and lies shattered the promises of old. When the Crimson Dawn came, the sons and daughters of the mountains turned against one other. They were no longer allies united behind one flag; no more did they share the same table at banquets held by the king of kings. Skori Whitebeerd, the last symbol of union amongst his people, refused to take sides. This decision cost him his life: he and his followers were assassinated by demon-serving cowards. This loathsome massacre spelled the end of the great unified kingdom of the Stubbyobs. </p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n\n<p> Today, the great hall of the Whitebeerds lies empty, with only the wind blowing through it. The other clans have turned inwards, away from the each other and the outside world. The Freezammers are fighting against an eternal winter; the Hard-Heads were chased out of their smithy by unnatural beings. The Firebrands lost their king and the Worldbeards glory in their dreams of battle. The Stonestomachs will not leave their kingdom. Only the Yergs stay true to their vow: they make sure that the scaly ones are no longer a threat to the World of Twelve. <br/><br/>\n\nThis is our story.

He is mainly known for his automatic hammer, his sledgehelm and his macinator. He also invented some more surprising items such as the buzzer that buzzes until you buzz off and the foam-protector, which is very useful in the vicinity of clumsy people (or pranksters) who get food in the beer of the people they sit next to at feasts. Everyone was expecting Durandial to win the contest hands down. </p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>During the first trial, the smith made a <b>throwing axe</b> that stunned the assembly. But a judge from the Freezammer clan found an irregularity; <b>the artisan's beard was apparently too short...</b> Accused of trimming his beard so it didn't get in his way while working, Durandial was disqualified. </p><br/> \n\n<p>This decision had serious consequences on the relationship between the Hard-Head and Freezammer clans; despite their family ties with the Freezammers, <b>King Thud Ymero Hard-Head</b> rejected the verdict and denounced it as a flagrant injustice.

Research on Arkastone led to the creation of arms and armour that were unequalled among all of the Stubbyob clans, so much so that the Hard-Heads began to replace all their base materials with Arkastone, which was much tougher and more hard-wearing. <br/><br/>\nAll the same, and against all expectations, the surrounding richness of Mount Neselite caused Gripus Ymero Hard-Head to lose his head and become greedy and covetous. He was ousted from the clan by Ragrul Ymero Hard-Head, his brother. </p>\n\n<pagefeed/><pagefeed/>\n\n<p> <b> Ragrul Ymero Hard-Head </b> </p> <br/> <br/>\n\n<p>Ragrul Ymero was one of the most famous rulers in Hard-Head history, known both for his ambition and for being lousy-pig-headed. Under his reign, work on the Undersmithy continued unceasingly in line with the original vision of creating the greatest forge of any Stubbyob clan. <br/><br/>\nHis desire to conquer the mountains led him to declare war on several races in the World of Twelve, especially the goblins, against whom he fought around thirty battles. <br/><br/>\nRagrul was a haughty and obstinate ruler who constantly pushed his clan to outdo themselves and make their mark on history. Under his reign, there was a lot more bloodshed than wondrous discoveries, however. The date that his reign ended remains unknown to this day. </p>\n\n<pagefeed/><pagefeed/>\n\n<p> <b> William Willbyforce Hard-Head   </b> </p> <br/> <br/>\n\n<p> The third king of the Hard-Head clan was chosen by his peers after the years of Ragrul Ymero's turbulent reign. <br/><br/>\nA popular ruler due to the social reforms he prompted, which greatly improved everyday village life, William Willbyforce was a key player in the Hard-Head community. It is often said that this man and his ideas made great contributions to the clan's stability. During the reign of William Willbyforce, very few events troubled the clan's peaceful existence. <br/><br/>\nWilliam Willbyforce was also one of the most respected rulers in all of Stubbyob history. Thus, after the traditional seven years of mourning following his death, the Stubbyobs from the Hard-Head clan decided to prolong their mourning by an additional seven years. <br/>\n\n<pagefeed/><pagefeed/>\n\n<p> <b> Einstone Ymero Hard-Head “the Clever” </b> </p> <br/> <br/>\n\n<p> Many long years of peace elapsed after William Willbyforce's reign, although it was sometimes still necessary to beat up the odd goblin now and then. Then King Einstone Ymero was crowned, famed for his exceptional intelligence among the Stubbyobs. <br/><br/>\nUnder his reign, the Hard-Heads finished their development of the Undersmithy, and the result made a huge impression on the Stubbyob clans. Einstone built a colossal dam atop Mount Neselite in order to bring water from mountain springs to the depths of the smithy. <br/><br/>\nAlthough many Stubbyobs had little understanding of what the project was all about, the dam was impressive and fun to build, and so the Hard-Heads were proud of it. Today, many believe that the Stubbyob face on the dam represents Einstone Ymero, but this has never been proven. The nose of the stone face was broken many times and repaired with molten Arkastone. <br/><br/>\n<pagefeed/>\nEinstone Ymero proposed a truce with the goblins, but it was rejected, so the goblin-beating resumed.  <br/><br/>After a time, however, tragedy struck. While the king was plumbing the still-unknown depths of Mount Neselite, a block of Arkastone fell on his head. This tragedy was long lamented by the Stubbyobs. <br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p> <b> Ninha Ymero Hard-Head </b> </p> <br/> <br/>\n\n<p> Ninha Ymero, the great-great-granddaughter of Einstone Ymero, was a very popular ruler with the Hard-Head clan. Ninha Ymero fostered Hard-Head culture and encouraged the Stubbyobs to develop their trade and businesses. <br/><br/>\nIt was during her reign that several breweries first emerged, most notably the Zeesmithy and Grodunk breweries, both opening on the same day, which marked the start of the long-running feud between the two establishments. <br/><br/>\nThis sovereign commissioned the first school for Hard-Head weeyobs and sponsored works on Stubbyob history for an immense library in the depths of the Undersmithy. Many Stubbyobs did not see the point in collecting so many books, but seeing as it was Ninha Ymero, they didn't complain too much. </p><br/><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>It was her reign that saw the appearance of one of the most legendary heroes the Hard-Head clan ever boasted: the valiant Tooth-Breaker, who drove back the goblins in a pitched battle. After he had broken the teeth of the goblin Zogiark the Terrifying and driven him out, Ninha Ymero Hard-Head married Tooth-Breaker. This grand wedding marked the beginning of long, prosperous years in the depths of the Undersmithy. </p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p> <b> Guhk Ymero Hard-Head </b> </p> <br/> <br/>\n<p> While no major event transpired to disrupt the daily life of the Hard-Heads under Guhk Ymero's reign, this sovereign is well-known in the Hard-Head clan for his marriage to Eitri Forganvil, cousin of Alvise Forganvil, queen of the Freezammer clan. <br/><br/>\nAlthough the Freezammer clan had always been one of the Hard-Heads' biggest competitors in the art of the forge, real hostilities only broke out between the two clans after the Smythposium, held on 7 Jullier in the year -7, during the reign of Thud, son of Guhk Ymero. <br/><br/>\nOne of the few significant events in the 400 years of Guhk Ymero's reign was the 777th victory against the goblins, which was celebrated with major festivities. After that, battles with the goblins happened less and less often. <br/>\n\n<pagefeed/><pagefeed/>\n\n<p> <b> Thud Ymero Hard-Head </b> </p> <br/> <br/>\n\n<p> The son of Guhk Ymero was another Ymero sovereign who made his mark on Hard-Head history.  However, he was certainly one of the least-liked rulers in all of Stubbyob history. Thud Ymero was mainly known for his aversion to beer and the enforcement of his B.E.A.R.D.Y. decree banning the consumption of alcohol during the working day. <br/><br/>\nFirst cousin of the Freezammers, he was all the more criticised after the Smythposium in which the queen mother, Eitri Forganvil, competed against Durandial, the Hard-Head champion. Durandial was disqualified by a Freezammer judge, a disqualification that was highly contested by the Hard-Head clan... but not so much by their king. <br/><br/>\n<pagefeed/>\nUnder the reign of Thud Ymero Hard-Head, there were more strikes and protests than all the other past reigns put together, up until Lord Cal Ymero, that is. Of special note is the Great 77-Day Strike, which took place after the B.E.A.R.D.Y. decree came into force, and ended in general brawling throughout the entire clan. <br/><br/>\nLuckily, the sovereign's reign was cut short by his tragic disappearance following an unfortunate incident with vegetables. The B.E.A.R.D.Y. decree was not enforced during the Stubbyobs' obligatory seven-year mourning period. His son, King Rodrick Ymero, had the decree repealed as soon as he was crowned. </p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p> <b> Rodrick Ymero Hard-Head </b> </p> <br/> <br/>\n\n<p> Although the son of a ruler who was little-liked and badly regarded by his people, Rodrick Ymero was not branded with the same reputation as his father, luckily for him. On the contrary, following the abolition of the B.E.A.R.D.Y. Decree, king Rodrick Ymero was very popular amongst his people throughout his life. To this day, he is still seen as one of the best rulers the clan ever had. Rodrick Ymero enjoyed one of the longest reigns, and it was most notably marked by the sad episode of the Undersmithy Disaster. <br/><br/>\nRodrick Ymero and his wife Thadad Ymero, née Stonebrewer, were very popular with their people because of the innovations and positive changes they brought about in the clan. Thadad Ymero was mainly known for popularising Stubbyob braiding, which became a popular fashion in the Undersmithy. <br/><br/>\nRodrick, a peerless knight and impressive axe-wielder, but also a renowned smith in his free time, helped restore the Hard-Head clan's image, which had become somewhat tarnished since the reign of his father. The Ymero family were no longer reproached for their distant alliance with the Freezammer clan. <br/>\n<pagefeed/>\nWhen the tragic events of the Undersmithy took place, it quickly became clear to the sovereign and his wife that the Hard-Heads would need to abandon the Undersmithy. During a particularly violent battle, while Rodrick Ymero was trying to contain the Stubbyobs who had been resurrected, he asked the survivors of the clan to flee alongside Queen Thadad Ymero and to seal off the Undersmithy without waiting for him. <br/><br/>\nDriven to despair, with a heavy heart weighed down by the anxious hope that her husband would rejoin them, Thadad Ymero could not allow her people to remain in danger. Reluctantly, she ordered the main gate to be sealed, and no one ever found out what became of their king. <br/><br/>\nThadad Ymero guided the Hard-Heads in the construction of their new village on Mount Neselite. The queen was of great help to the clan who were undone by the catastrophe and in mourning. She helped them find their feet again, and inspired them not to be discouraged by the loss of their home. <br/><br/>\nUnfortunately, as she was already very old for a Stubbyob, Thadad Ymero passed away during the seven years of mourning for her husband, leaving the reins of the Hard-Head clan to her very young son, Cal Ymero. <br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p> <b> Cal Ymero Hard-Head </b> </p> <br/> <br/>\n\n<p> Cal Ymero is the youngest ruler the Stubbyobs have ever had. Crowned at the age of 127, he succeeded his father, Rodrick Ymero, who was greatly loved by the Hard-Head clan. <br/><br/>\nUnfortunately for the young sovereign, he took the throne during a very difficult time for the Hard-Heads and had to learn how to rule while leading his people as they rebuilt the clan. <br/><br/>\nLike his grandfather before him, Cal Ymero is a contentious ruler due to his family ties to the Freezammers, and also for his lack of experience in ruling due to his youth. <br/><br/>\nSince the sad episode of the Undersmithy disaster which occurred during his father's reign, the doors of the Undersmithy have remained sealed, and no one has returned inside of the mountain. </p>","contentCSS":"li {\r\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\r\n}\r\nbody {\r\n\tcolor: #000000;\r\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\r\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\r\n\tfont-style: normal;\r\n\tfont-weight: normal;\r\n\tlist-style-type: none;\r\n\ttext-align: justify;\r\n\ttext-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\na {\r\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\r\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\r\n}\r\np {\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\r\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\r\n}\r\nol {\r\n\tlist-style-type: square;\r\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\r\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\r\n}\r\n"},"399":{"id":399,"typeId":1,"titleId":"Paztek for Dummies","authorId":"","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Foreword</b></p><br/><br/>\n<p>This book presents the rudiments of the language of an unknown people, the Pazteks.<br/><br/>\nMissing from most of the history books of Amakna, this insular people with quite unusual customs have a belief system that is very different from that of other Twelvians. Perhaps this is why they have sought to describe the world around them with their own words. Yet, it is said that they previously lived on the continent.<br/><br/>\nWhy did they leave? A detailed study of their language, traditions, taboos, and ideals would perhaps provide answers to those who wish to know more.<br/><br/>\nFor adventurers in a hurry, even basic knowledge of Paztek vocabulary will help them understand and be understood by these mysterious wearers of masks.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n<p><b>Principles of Grammar</b></p><br/>\n<p><b>Sentence Structure</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>The Paztek language is grounded in emotions. Indeed, in Paztek, every sentence is obligatorily grounded in an emotion, and this grounding is marked at the start of every sentence.</p><br/><br/>\n\n<p><b>Grounding Emotion - (adjective) - DO/IO - Verb+Subject</b></p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>This can be illustrated by translating the following sentence:<br/><i>\"I eat a red api.\"</i><br/><br/>\nIn Paztek, this would be:<br/>\"Nalla rad pada madoufnass\"<br/><br/><br/>\n<b>Nalla:</b> Here, the grounding emotion is neutral as no specific emotion is being communicated. The marker \"Nalla\" indicates this neutrality and is placed at the start of the sentence.<br/><br/>\n<b>Rad:</b> red, an adjective. It is placed immediately before the object it describes.<br/><br/>\n<b>Pada:</b> Api<br/><br/>\n<b>Madoufnass:</b> \"I eat\". Here, \"madouf\" is the verb \"to eat\" and \"nass\" is the subject, \"I\". The subject is always attached to the verb at the end of the sentence.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Grounding: Emotions and Tones</b></p><br/>\n\nApissa = <i>extreme politeness</i><br/>\nBalla = <i>romantic tone</i><br/>\nBallu = <i>seductive tone</i><br/>\nBradu = <i>bitterness</i><br/>\nChuba = <i>fear</i><br/>\nDelulla = <i>mistrust</i><br/>\nGalla = <i>enthusiastic tone</i><br/>\nLulla = <i>confusion, lack of understanding</i><br/>\nNaballa = <i>awe, reverence (often used when speaking of gods and religion)</i><br/>\n<b>Nalla</b> = <i>neutral tone</i><br/>\nNiapu = <i>disgust</i><br/>\nPravuk = <i>pleading, entreaty</i><br/>\nTachuba = <i>horror</i><br/>\nTatumu = <i>deep sadness, pain</i><br/>\nTchala = <i>very friendly tone</i><br/>\nTeg = <i>tiredness</i><br/>\nTsuma = <i>surprise, astonishment</i><br/>\nTumu = <i>sadness</i><br/>\nTurtta = <i>order, imperative tone</i><br/>\nVarch = <i>hostility</i><br/>\nVina = <i>worry</i><br/>\nVizteg = <i>exhaustion</i><br/>\nVurtag = <i>determination</i><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<br/>Emotion words may also be used alone to express a direct emotion or feeling.<br/><br/>\n\nFor example:<br/><br/> \n\nNiapu: <i>How horrible!</i><br/>\nVizteg: <i>I'm exhausted.</i><br/>\nLulla: <i>Why?</i><br/>\nTurtta: <i>Obey!</i><br/>\nBalla: <i>I love you.</i><br/>\nTchala: <i>Hi!</i> \n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Negation</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>Negation is expressed by adding <b>\"bor\"</b> to the very end of the sentence.<br/><br/>\n\nExample:<br/><br/>\n<i>Nalla a kaspiknass</i> = I understand you.<br/><br/>\n<b>nalla:</b> neutral tone<br/> \n<b>a:</b> you<br/>\n<b>kaspik:</b> to understand<br/>\n<b>nass:</b> I<br/><br/>\n\n<i>Lulla a kaspiknass bor</i> = I don't understand you.<br/><br/>\n<b>Lulla:</b> confusion, lack of understanding<br/>\n<b>a:</b> you<br/>\n<b>kaspik:</b> to understand<br/>\n<b>nass:</b> I<br/>\n<b>bor:</b> negation<br/></p> \n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Interrogative Mood</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>When the speaker wishes to formulate a question, the word <b>\"Til\"</b> is added to the start of the sentence, before the grounding emotion. Question marks are not used in the Paztek language.<br/><br/>\n\nExample:<br/><br/>\n<i>Til nalla tsé kazkoulnass</i> = Do I kill him?<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Til:</b> question<br/>\n<b>nalla:</b> neutral tone<br/>\n<b>tsé:</b> he/she/it<br/>\n<b>kazkoul:</b> to kill<br/>\n<b>nass:</b> I<br/></p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Conjugating Verbs</b></p><br/><br/>\n\n<p>Conjugation is simple in Paztek. The past and future are expressed simply as suffixes.</p><br/><br/>\n\n<p><b>Future Tense</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>When speaking in future tense, the prefix \"tur-\" is added before the verb.<br/><br/>\n\nExample:<br/><br/>\n<i>Nalla a tur-madoufnass</i> = I'm going to eat you.<br/><br/>\n<b>Nalla:</b> neutral tone<br/>\n<b>a:</b> you<br/>\n<b>tur-:</b> future<br/>\n<b>madouf:</b> to eat<br/>\n<b>nass:</b> I</p><br/><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Past Tense</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>When speaking in past tense, the prefix \"jadi-\" is added before the verb.<br/><br/>\n\nExample:<br/><br/>\n<i>Nalla a jadi-madoufnass</i> = I ate you<br/><br/>\n<b>Nalla:</b> neutral tone<br/>\n<b>a:</b> you<br/>\n<b>jadi-:</b> past<br/>\n<b>madouf:</b> to eat<br/>\n<b>nass:</b> I</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Temporal Adverbs</b></p><br/><br/>\n\n<p>Temporal adverbs are placed before the verb.<br/><br/>\n\nExample:<br/><br/>\n<i>Galla Frigost tatchi tur-variganass</i> = I will arrive in Frigost tomorrow.<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Galla:</b> enthusiasm<br/>\n<b>Tatchi:</b> tomorrow<br/>\n<b>Tur-:</b> future<br/>\n<b>Variga:</b> arrive (in)<br/>\n<b>Nass:</b> I<br/></p> \n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Subject Pronouns</b></p><br/>\n \n<p><b>Nass:</b> I<br/>\n<b>A:</b> you<br/>\n<b>Tsé (-sé):</b> he/she/it (they)<br/>\n<b>Baldu (-aldu):</b> we<br/>\n<b>Tsa (-sa):</b> them<br/>\n<b>Ala:</b> you (formal: used exclusively when speaking to one or more gods)</p><br/><br/>\n\n<p><b>Possession</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>To correctly mark the possessive, the corresponding possessive adjective is placed before the noun in question.<br/><br/>\n\nExample:<br/><br/>\n<i>Til nalla lek kakiba-a-patriak</i> = Where are your people?<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Til:</b> question<br/>\n<b>nalla:</b> neutral tone<br/>\n<b>lek:</b> where<br/>\n<b>kakiba:</b> to be located, to be somewhere<br/>\n<b>a:</b> you/your<br/>\n<b>patriak:</b> people</p>\n\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Use of a Different Subject</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>When the subject is a name, the name will be used in place of the subject in the sentence.<br/><br/>\n\nExample:<br/><br/>\n<i>Nalla batchiz rida-Herdegrize</i> = Herdegrize loves books.<br/><br/>\n\n<b>Nalla:</b> neutral tone<br/>\n<b>Batchi:</b> book (plural: batchiz)<br/>\n<b>Rida:</b> love</p><br/><br/>\n\n<p><b>The Plural</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>To express a word in plural form, the suffix <b>\"-z\"</b> or <b>\"-ez\"</b> (after a consonant) is added to the end of the word.<br/><br/>\n\nExample:<br/><br/>\nZofiau (Gupin) - Zofiauz (Gupins)<br/>\nOmin (Koalak) - Ominez (Koalaks)</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>Directions</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>Nar = <i>north</i><br/>\nSad = <i>south</i><br/>\nEtta = <i>east</i><br/>\nOtta = <i>west</i><br/><br/>\n\nNaretta = <i>northeast</i><br/>\nNarotta = <i>northwest</i><br/>\nSadotta = <i>southwest</i><br/>\nSadetta = <i>southeast<br/></i><br/><br/>\n\n<b>\"Es\"</b> is generally placed before the direction one wishes to include in the sentence.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n \n<p><b>The Concept of Wind Among the Paztek</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>The Pazteks are deeply attached to the wind, the air, and the meanings that they can carry.<br/>\nTherefore, when someone mentions the wind in a story or conversation, they are often expressing an emotion, a fear or a particular feeling.<br/><br/>\nHere are a few examples: <br/><br/>\nJarku = <i>wind of change</i><br/>\nJafunra = <i>wind of rest, wind of mourning</i><br/>\nJarkazku = <i>breath of death</i><br/>\nJaruba = <i>wind of fear</i><br/>\nJarballa = <i>wind of passion</i> (romantic)</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent:

This prohibition is similar to the precepts of the <b>Masqueraiders:</b> scholars have, therefore, speculated that there is some kind of kinship between the two peoples.<br/><br/>\nIn the Pazteks' religious rituals, gold is associated with Father <b>Tikka</b> (the sun), and silver with Mother <b>Shibal</b> (the moon).<br/><br/>\nThe Pazteks' diet consists mainly of fish and fruit. The Galidylez' diet consists mainly of Pazteks and fruit. The Chaklaz' (Piraniaks') diet consists mainly of Pazteks and Galidylez.<br/><br/>\nThe <b>pazteka</b> (watermelon) is a fruit that is sacred to Pazteks. According to certain beliefs, it is linked to a creature called <b>Kagali Shibal</b> (the Scaly Mother). Ingesting a large quantity of Paztekaz apparently makes it possible to have prophetic visions of the future (and causes a desperate urge to go and urinate behind a bush).</p><br/><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\nThe <b>Malavin</b> (seagull) is a bird that it's best to avoid upsetting, unless you want trouble of the worst kind, from a simple dropping inadvertently landing on your head to chronic misfortune passed down from generation to generation. According to an age-old proverb, a fulfilled Malavin can change the world. Its \"Caw!\" is both dreaded and desired by all Paztek fisherman (and boat owners in general).<br/><br/>\nThe <b>Zofiau</b> (Gupin) seems to be well-known to the Pazteks, although this cousin of the Pingwins comes from Frigost Island. According to legend, the Zofiau is able to \"vina Krosmoz krousti\" (break the Krosmoz) if left unattended. The source of this rather frightening myth remains unknown.<br/><br/>\nIn general, Pazteks dislike the colour <b>berk</b> (green). This may be due to the many dangers that abound in the jungle covering part of their island. There is a rumour (albeit it unproven) that young Pazteks are allergic to green vegetables.</p><br/><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>The <b>Omin</b> (Koalak) people have apparently helped the Pazteks during certain events throughout their history. The <b>Jon Omin</b> (Bloody Koalak) is famous for its ability to do the work of ten people, as well as for its intemperate love of hops-based drinks, Kazteks (a sort of visored headgear) and dubious puns.<br/><br/>\n<b>Paztaga</b> is a ritual drink that is the colour of the sun, consumed during hot weather. It seems to go hand in hand with a certain <b>ball game</b> with varying rules based on bad faith and the ability of participants to exaggerate reality.<br/><br/>\nFor Pazteks, <b>Dodu</b> (Dough-Dough) feathers are more precious than gold. They are also more comfortable for filling mattresses.<br/><br/>\nThere is a legend that a Pandawa explorer invented <b>chocolate</b> after having shared a bitter, spicy drink with a Paztek. The explorer was apparently an ancestor of Stayfun Bonnawa.</p><br/><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>There is a myth that a <b>city of roads paved with gold</b> lies across the Antinau Sea, and that its inhabitants are Crocodyls wearing masks. It is said that the mere sight of this marvellous city could drive any Enutrof mad.<br/><br/>\nPazteks hate <b>Kakapikez</b> (Moskitos), which they shamelessly squash whenever they get the chance. A Paztek alchemist apparently developed a gas capable of eradicating these harmful insects that is released into the air using an ingenious system that makes liquid boil at precise times throughout the night. There's no stopping progress.<br/><br/>\nContrary to Moskitos, <b>Araknaz</b> (Arachnees) are spared by the Pazteks, who consider them to be useful creatures. Nonetheless, once they get larger than a certain size, reducing Araknaz to a pulp is acceptable.</p><br/><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\nIt is said that Pazteks invented a complex cyclic <b>calendar</b> based on the movements of the planets in the Krosmoz, cardinal points and divinatory space-time. They eventually abandoned this dating system because it utterly confused them. Moreover, seeing the end of the world appear on the calendar every year became rather tiresome. Nobody knows if the goddess <b>Mahiya</b> might have had something to do with this.<br/><br/>\nIf certain slightly fanciful scholars are to be believed, the Pazteks are the inventors of sweeteks, beefsteks, salamitek and slices of cakek.</p>","contentCSS":"li {\n\ttext-indent: 12pt;\n}\nbody {\n\tcolor: #000000;\n\tfont-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\n\tfont-size: 18pt;\n\tfont-style: normal;\n\tfont-weight: normal;\n\tlist-style-type: none;\n\ttext-align: justify;\n\ttext-decoration: none;\n}\na {\n\tcolor: #0000FF;\n\ttext-decoration: underline;\n}\np {\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class7 {\n\tlist-style-type: circle;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class5 {\n\tfont-style: italic;\n}\n.document_content2_fr-class6 {\n\tfont-weight: bold;\n}\nol {\n\tlist-style-type: square;\n\tmargin-bottom: 0%;\n\tmargin-top: 0%;\n}\n"},"402":{"id":402,"typeId":2,"titleId":"Handwritten Page","authorId":"","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p>Vizteg!<br/><br/>\n\nVizteg es Amakna nifi jadi-variganass.

Climb as many floors as possible to earn maximum rewards!</p>\n\n<h1>Prizes</h1>\n\n(Insert Fufu table here)\n\n<p>For each floor, you'll be given tokens when you complete the final threshold. A threshold completed in \"Classic\" difficulty will win you six tokens, whereas a threshold completed in \"Nightmare\" mode will win you 12.</p>\n\n<p>These tokens serve as currency on Ascension Island. You can use them to purchase the resources necessary to craft new equipment from an NPC in one of the temple rooms.</p>\n\n<p>Dofus fragments will allow you to obtain a Dofus. They can also be traded to the merchant NPC for a few tokens.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to tokens and Dofus fragments, players at the top of the rankings can proudly bear an ornament depending on their ranking on their server. These ornaments will be unlocked for one rotation based on the ranking achieved during the previous rotation. So you mustn't rest on your laurels if you want to keep your title!</p>\n\n<h1>Scoring</h1>\n\n<p>The score you are able to achieve on Ascension Island depends mainly on two factors.</p>\n\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Each floor you complete in \"Classic\" mode will earn you 100 points.</li>\n<li>Each floor you complete in \"Nightmare\" mode will earn you 150 points.</li>\n<li>Completing the entire \"Classic\" mode will give you 200 extra points.</li>\n<li>Completing the entire \"Nightmare\" mode will give you 300 extra points.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Challenges</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Each fight will offer five challenges that you may choose to complete – or not.</li>\n<li>Each completed challenge will give you a certain number of points.</li>\n<li>For each challenge completed during a fight, a fixed \"combo\" bonus is added to the fight score according to the scale below.</li>\n</ul>\n\n1 challenge completed = 0 bonus points\n2 challenges completed = 15 bonus points\n3 challenges completed = 30 bonus points\n4 challenges completed = 50 bonus points\n5 challenges completed = 75 bonus points\n\n<h2>Survival</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your score will suffer a penalty every time a teammate dies in a fight.</li>\n<li>Resurrection effects cannot remove this penalty.</li>\n<li>However, death after being resurrected will not raise the penalty (if a player dies, is revived, then dies again, the penalty will apply only once).</li>\n<li>The score will be validated at the end of each threshold. Once all three fights in a threshold have been completed, the scores from the fights will be validated and saved.</li>\n<li>If you don't manage to complete a threshold, the scores from the completed floors will not be saved.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Improving Your Score</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>With each new rotation, you'll receive 8 items that allow you to return to a previously completed threshold in order to improve your score there.</li>\n<li>These items are available in limited quantities, so you'll only be able to improve certain thresholds. It's up to you to choose which ones to improve to get the best final score.</li>\n<li>You can use them in both Classic and Nightmare mode.</li>\n<li>As with initial score validation, you'll need to complete the entire threshold in order to validate the scores for the three floors.</li>\n<li>Only the best overall score from the threshold is saved. This way, if your attempt at improvement turns out to be less satisfactory than the initial validation, your score will not be lowered.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>How It Works</h1>\n\n<h2>Progress</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ascension Island is divided into several parts called thresholds.</li>\n<li>Each threshold is a group of three floors that's always structured in the same way: standard floor -> standard floor -> boss floor.</li>\n<li>The island is divided into 16 thresholds of three floors each, plus two special boss floors.</li>\n<li>Each threshold contains a monster family chosen at random, the level of which is determined by the floor number. The higher the floor number, the higher the level of the monsters you'll encounter.</li>\n<li>Your goal is to complete as many floors as possible in order to collect the most rewards and get the highest score possible.</li>\n<li>Losing a fight or exiting in the middle of a threshold will require you to start over from the first floor of the threshold the next time you attempt it.</li>\n<li>1 to 3 players can take part in Ascension Island fights together. The monster groups you'll face consist of four or five opponents.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Difficulty</h2>\n\n<p>Ascension Island is available in two difficulties:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Classic mode features monsters at levels 100 to 200.</li>\n<li>Nightmare mode features monsters at levels 200 to 300.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In order to unlock \"Nightmare\" mode from the NPC at the entrance, you will first need to complete all 50 floors in Classic mode.</p>\n\n<p>Once Nightmare mode is unlocked, you can enter Ascension Island again and try to work your way through the 50 floors.</p>\n\n<p>Everything works the same way as it does in Classic mode, but the monster families you encounter are different and the rewards are greater.</p>\n\n<h2>Rotations</h2>\n\n<p>Roughly every two months, the content of Ascension Island is reset in order to change how the monster families are distributed across thresholds, and also how the combat area is laid out. However, for maps where you face bosses, the starting obstacles and placements remain the same for all rotations.</p>\n\n<p>During a single rotation, all players encounter the same monsters on the same floors and at the same levels. The challenges are identical, as are the starting placement slots.</p>\n\n<p>With each new rotation, your progress will be reset and your previous score will be saved.</p>","contentCSS":""},"405":{"id":405,"typeId":2,"titleId":"A LETTER TO MY PEOPLE","authorId":"Mucane","subTitleId":"","contentId":"<p> My people. My... dear, dear people.<br/><br/>\n\nWhatever acts and crimes I may have committed, please know that it has always been your safety that I've been fighting for. Day after day, I work the raw clay of our salvation, of our liberty, with my own dry hands. No one has the right to enslave us. No one has the right to ridicule our beliefs and trample our fervour. I will rise up against them all if I must. Against those who have always been my enemies, but also those yet to come. Against you, stranger, you who rise to face me, your vanity and your pride filled to bursting with a foul poison that devours you. And I rise to face you, my brother, who are ready to cast your convictions aside to don the mask of treachery.<br/><br/>\n\nI will fight. Even if I lose my mind and my senses along the way. If I must give my eyes and my flesh, my lungs and my body, I will fight. For if the life I have inherited is that of a fugitive, it is the life of a conqueror that I have chosen to earn. You can hate me for what I have done. Call me a criminal and point accusing fingers. Cover me in disdain and call me an oathbreaker. I've stopped believing in miracles. Stopped believing that somewhere far away, in the lands where those who have rejected us live their lives, there might be a solution to all of our suffering. And so, brothers and sisters, family and friends, extend your weapons to me, lend me your spells. Give me your trust and your blessing. I shall turn my body into a shield. For if my physical form is still standing, my true being died on the day we lost it all.<br/><br/>\n\nI will not play the loyal messiah of some fanatical people, nor even the martyr driven mad by years spent awash in an inexorable faith. Even here, I will be as I have always been: a priestess in service to her people, just as Mazin Lyn was before me. I hope that one day, I will again tread the soft earth of our home, be able to call a place \"mako\" once more, and feel free and strong, surrounded by those who are dear to me. I believe that this will one day be possible. Thanks to him. Him... he is the last person I want to chain myself to. He is the last one I want to give everything to.<br/><br/>\n\nMy brother, you may reproach me for having gone too far. For having gone beyond the sensible life I was given. For having braved the seas to raise hurricanes. For having fought the heavens to draw down the lightning. I will agree that this is true. That I have done what others never could have done. That I have taken my own life in my hands, and those of the people I love, without asking their opinion. Did I really have a choice? For if I had not done it, who else could have? Would you have stood up, dear brother, to help our people? Would you have plunged yourself completely into suffering and pain to allay the evil that eats away at us? Would you have fought those savages and exposed your body, dripping with our enemies' blood and entrails, in order to scare them away? No... You were never the rebel of the family, were you?

Each wanted to spread as wide as possible, overtaking the other. Trees grew to the sky, towering over the sea, becoming larger every day, tickling the clouds with their rustling leaves. The forest cast its shadow over the waters, confining them to chilly darkness. The waves tried incessantly to submerge the land... But they always withdrew because they would break against the woody bodies of the mangrove trees.</p><br/>\n\n<p>At the edge of the jungle, alone in front of the sea, the mangrove trees were the rainforest's rampart against the assaults of the tides. Their roots were manifold, deep, sinuous, and deeply anchored in the nourishing soil. Without their vigilance, the borders of the forest would have been devoured by the ocean's foamy maw.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>One day, a small Arachnee spun her web in the tallest of the mangrove trees. Food was plentiful in the giant tree's branches; the wind from the ocean carried insects that would get caught in her silken webs, like fish in a fisherman's nets. The Arachnee was afraid of drowning and it terrified her to see young trees bend then break under the weight of the diluvial rains. The old mangrove tree provided certain shelter. He would never break.</p><br/>\n\n<p>The large tree was amused by the spinner's dancing with her agile, fragile, graceful feet. He developed a deep affection for the Arachnee. While she swung between his leaves, carefree, he told her forgotten stories that only the ancient trees could remember.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Time passed. The forest gained ground. The furious waters attempted in vain to uproot the old mangrove tree. High in his branches, the Arachnee danced, mocking the sea that couldn't reach her.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>At the height of its anger, the ocean gave birth to an immense, gigantic wave whose foam reached the clouds. Towering over the highest treetops, the wave advanced, growling, and crashed into the large mangrove tree. He remained upright, while the trees around him were scattered like wisps of straw. He defied the ocean, resisting the weight of waters able to down a mountain... The Arachnee was not so lucky.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Swallowed by the wave, the spinner clung to her web. She attempted valiantly to hold on, but her silken threads eventually broke. The small creature was carried off, without a sound. She disappeared under the waters.</p><br/>\n\n<p>The old mangrove tree uprooted himself, lifting his roots, walking like the Arachnee who had kept him company. He moved slowly towards the ocean. The other mangrove trees rose up as well, then stopped. They were the children and guardians of the forest. They could not leave the primordial jungle without endangering it.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>The large tree gestured goodbye to his brothers, and then the sea closed over him. Satisfied with this sacrifice, the ocean calmed.</p><br/>\n\n<p>And thus was born the mangrove, the barrier made of trees with long, salt-encrusted roots. And thus was born the bayou. And while the mangrove trees watch over the islands in the archipelago, forever sentinels eyeing the ocean, it is said that the oldest among them still walks the ocean floor in search of the Arachnee who once danced in his branches.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>The Legend of Crocuzko</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>In the western part of the Archipelago of Scales, there is a very sinister island covered by eternal, starless night – Crocuzko. But while Crocuzko seems dark and sad now, it wasn't always the case.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Crocuzko and Orado have always been sister islands caressed by the same ocean breeze, the same rays of the sun, and the same starlight. Life was good for Ixchelonia, the moon-turtle goddess, and Kinichinti, the sun-lizard god, as they watched over their children living on both islands. Kinichinti caused the suns rays to glow in splendour over the archipelago, playing with making the light glow in every corner of the islands or piercing the shadows in the bayou with burst of sunlight. Then, every evening, he made way for his beloved Ixchelonia. She give birth to a gentle, calm night over the waves. And serene peace would fall slowly over the archipelago while Kinichinti would amuse his beloved by making the stars glimmer.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Years went by. Years of peace for the Crocodyls on the archipelago, years in which they enjoyed Kinichinti's daytime antics as much as they enjoyed Ixchelonia's starry softness. But one day, everything changed for the two divinities. One day, as Kinichinti was shining brightly throughout Crocuzko, he came across a Crocodyl sitting by the sea. Kinichinti took the shape of a golden lizard and moved softly over to the reptile. And there he saw the depths of the Crocodyl's azure eyes. They spoke for hours, until the very second Kinichinti had to give way to Ixchelonia. That night, the stars glimmered less brightly.</p><br/>\n\n<p>The next day, when Kinichinti's rays of sun appeared, the golden lizard slipped tenderly to Crocuzko beach, eager for the Crocodyl's return. When she emerged from the edges of the bayou, Kinichinti couldn't help but feel a wave of pleasure at the sight of her. The two reptiles spend the day together. As they did the next day. And the day after that. The days seemed to grow longer, the sun was bright and hot, and nights seemed shorter and shorter on the archipelago.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Ixchelonia felt more and more abandoned by her beloved, but didn't understand why he was so distant. One morning, after an especially short night, Ixchelonia decided to follow Kinichinti. In the form of a turtle with a white shell, she learned to her dismay that Kinichinti was smitten with the azure-eyed Crocodyl. Ixchelonia's sadness rapidly turned to anger, and the sky was suddenly covered with inexorable darkness, a darkness so dark that it was impossible to find one's bearings in the pitch black. Kinichinti, now unable to see the face of the beautiful Crocodyl, understood the sudden nature of the darkness.</p><br/>\n\n<p>So, the Sun Lizard went to his beloved, who was heading for Orado. Kinichinti pleaded with her. In vain. And, as Ixchelonia was preparing to bring the same eternal night down over Orado Island, she turned to the one she had always loved. </p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>She threatened to plunge the Archipelago of Scales into darkest night, a night so black that the waves of the sea would swallow all the islands up without seeing them. When he asked the goddess what he could do to make up for his mistakes, she ordered him to shine the sun's rays into the Crocodyl's eyes until those very rays had burnt her eyes out.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Horrified by the fate awaiting the Archipelago of Scales if he didn't obey, Kinichinti obeyed and made the sun burn so bright in the Crocodyl's eyes that the heat burned them entirely. Before the bloody eyes of the beauty, Kinichinti was overcome with despair and his helplessness lead him to insanity. Then, he burned the eyes of all the Crocodyls on the Island of Crocuzko.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>They say that Crocuzko's eternal night has never lifted, and the stars no longer shine over the island. A heavy, anxiety-filled silence has replaced the serenity of the nights there and, in the dark, the silhouettes of the red-eyed Crocodyls that still live on Crocuzko move about.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>The Scarlet Lotus</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>For a century, the emperor Croctezuma left his sumptuous palace to visit a pond on the same day every year. He would sit among the rushes and reeds while the Prancing Chimeras ended their nightly symphony of croaks with a flourish and the yellow-crested Froggies sang in concert to celebrate the rising sun. </p><br/>\n\n<p>All day long, during the hours marking off Kinichinti's passage, the emperor would watch a lotus on the surface of the water – a scarlet lotus that stood out among the white flowers floating delicately on the mirror made of troubled waters. He stayed silent, mindless of the guards posted some ways away and the slaves ready to execute his slightest desires.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>At dusk, finally, Croctezuma would rise and follow the road back to the imperial city in silence. His most attentive servants would sometimes see a tear pearl up in the corner of his eye, shimmering in the light of Ixchelonia's silver shell, but they never mentioned it to anyone because everyone knows that emperors never cry.</p><br/>\n\n<p>So, what was the purpose of this strange ceremony, repeated so many times over the years? The priests took it as a sign of devotion to Chaklaplok, the famished god of biting waters. Had the emperor sworn an oath, made a promise that he couldn't break? Had he sacrificed someone he cared about to the Piraniaks lurking in the depths, greedy for the flesh of a loved one? No one seemed to have any memory of it.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>In the palace halls, courtesans hypocritically whispered that Croctezuma had failed, and that the blood-coloured flower was proof that he had committed some fault, a sacrilege, an unforgivable crime. It goes without saying that these disloyal subjects were punished in the most severe ways if they were ever uncovered. Their viper tongues hung out of their open maws as they agonised on the top of the pyramid of traitors, their eyes rolled back, their guts spilling out onto the floor to feed the famished varans.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Was the scarlet lotus the symbol of a lost love, or the signature of a bloody pact? Was it an offering to the Scaly Mother, or the cradle of a ruby born from the swamp mud? Every citizen in the empire had their own theory on the subject... but the only one who knew the truth was Croctezuma.</p>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>On the evening of the last day of his reign, in the dusk of his life, the emperor called his son Viracroca to his bedside. While the doctors attempted one last bleeding, applying a host of leeches to the weakened body of the old Crocodyl, Croctezuma revealed his secret to his heir. He spoke of a prophecy. He spoke of a major battle, and of a grey dragon. He spoke of the death of the one that would be called the Jade Bloodlord, and of the tragedy that would follow. He spoke of the Crocodyls' blood, which would flow like a river and stain the sacred flowers' petals red before drying up forever. Every year, as he stared at the scarlet lotus, Croctezuma prayed that the visions that haunted him would not come true... all the while knowing that his destiny was to work to make them possible.</p><br/>\n\n<p>That night, and for the very first time, the emperor's son cried.

For weeks, all I've done is write alchemy formulas! I'm starting a new journal because I can't find my first. Could I have left it in Amakna? If so, I hope no one has found it! It contains a few embarrassing details.\nThe past two months have been very full. After I reached Frigost Island, I travelled to the slopes of Mount Scauldron in the dead of winter to set up my laboratory. Temperatures were very low... I nearly froze on site, but I only lost two toes in the ordeal. Nothing really! Alas, the extreme cold only lasted a very short time. Luckily, I concocted refrigerating elixirs and have stored a huge quantity of ice. I should be able to stock up on the cold for my experiments.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><u>8 Aperirel 550</u></p>\n<br><p>They say that you need to watch out for cold snaps in Aperirel, and I think I've brought the saying to life! I've managed to create a bank of freezing fog to cool the area around my laboratory. I am going to be able to continue my work without waiting for next winter. I'm considering building a greenhouse for some of my plants, but I'll need workers for that... I wonder if the hairy brutes that I've run into in the area on several occasions could help me. They don't seem to be aggressive if you don't provoke them.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><u>19 Junssidor 550</u></p>\n<br><p>The greenhouse is complete! Good work, done well. The Bearbarians have been rather friendly, and I was able to negotiate with their leader, a spiritual guide of sorts who spends a large part of his days gorging on honey. He gave me everything I needed in exchange for allowing his worker bees free access to my plants. I agreed. Especially since I've learned of the existence of a celestial nectar with highly interesting properties. I think I might add a few drops to the next version of my potion. I am very hopeful that I will make progress in my research!</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><u>15 Jullier 550</u></p>\n<br><p>After several swarms were killed, poisoned by some of my plants, my relationship with the Bearbarians has deteriorated. They don't want to have anything to do with me. So, I stay away from their hive, and they stay away from my greenhouse. The Alchimeras that I've created from elemental fluids ensure my safety, but I have trouble sleeping. I feel like all progress has stalled, and like I'm trapped in my own mind. I wonder if the solitude is starting to get to me.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><u>8 Frauguctor 550</u></p>\n<br><p>A traveller on his way to the top of Mount Scauldron got lost and stumbled across my greenhouse. I offered him my hospitality. He filled me in on the news in the region: a village is being built at the base of the mountain, and all its inhabitants are working on a massive project. He would probably have told me more about it if he'd been able to withstand the cold better... I think his heart froze in his chest. I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to test my latest conservation elixir! He made an excellent guinea pig.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><u>22 Frauguctor 550</u></p>\n<br><p>I've decided!

I haven't had anyone to talk to since Krikri, the last rat in the room, died. I was forced to sacrifice Krikri today because I didn't have anything else for afternoon tea. I hated having to do it, but Krikri is much happier dead than starving.<br/>\nI've been here for several days now, and it's starting to get really hot in here. I wonder where all the water we used to have has gone to. Even if we couldn't drink it, at least it helped regulate the heat.  My beer supplies are dwindling, and I don't want to think about what's in store for me when the barrels are empty.<br/>\nThat'll teach me to nod off while the others are working. My mum was always going on about that, and she's definitely going to give me a good scolding when I get home. Maybe it'd be better not to go home... What do you think, my paper friend? I don't know which scares me more – my mum yelling or the screams coming from the depths of the Undersmithy.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n \n<p>Today, I decided to try and grill the last piece of Krikri. Mum always grills other animals but I'm not sure how it's done. I'm afraid I'll burn myself, but given the taste of raw rat compared to cooked rat, it's a risk worth taking.\nP.S. My beard caught fire while I was cooking, but I think I managed to cook the meat a bit. It didn't taste as bad as usual.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n \n<p>I've been thinking, and I've decided I should try to get out of this room.  I've been here for 12 days now, and no one has come looking for me, not even my mum. I think they don't want to come because they're afraid of the screams. But, if I leave, maybe my mum will be proud of me. She's always said that it's better I wait for someone to help me because it's safer for me that way. I think she's right. But I'm hungry. I'm going to try to open the wooden door at the top of the stairs just to see what's there. I hope there'll be beer.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n \n<p>My visit to the next room over was the best experience of my life. I was very scared, but I found beer and that's all that counts. I also met three new rats. I've only eaten two so far, because I've been talking to the third a lot. I can't wait to see my mum and tell her all about it. She's never going to believe me!</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n\n<p>Last night, I heard scratching on the door. At first, I thought it was new rats coming for a visit, but when I went to open the door, I realised it was something much bigger. I heard a lot of growling and was very afraid. I don't know what it was exactly, but I couldn't sleep for a long time.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n \nToday, I went back to the next rooms over to get beer. It was as dark as the first time. But this time, I decided to light a torch, and it was much easier to catch rats. I think I'll take a torch with me wherever I go from now on.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n \n<p>Today, I've decided to visit the Undersmithy furnaces! I've always wanted to see the smithy up close. But my mum would never let me go places I wasn't supposed to be. At work, we always took the same path so I haven't seen much of the inside of the Undersmithy in all these years.<br/>\nI took my torch and went further than the last beer barrels I found. I found rooms filled with weapons and armour. I was able to find a few skewers to cook the remaining rats. I do wonder how they manage to find food here, though. The wrought iron pieces are really beautiful, and I'm proud to have contributed to them even just a little. I even found jewels that will probably be set into weapons and armour. I'd love to learn how to do that. My mum won't ever allow it, though... I wonder if maybe I shouldn't try all the same.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n\n<p>I heard scratching and growling at the door again last night. Now I'm sure that it's not coming from rats. I grabbed one of the weapons I found deep in the Undersmithy. I don't know how to use it, but I'm a Stubbyob so I'm sure it's in my blood. The growling didn't last long and I was able to sleep.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n \n<p>I tried to explore more of the Undersmithy today, but I ran into something bad. I was very scared and had to run and hide. I couldn't really see what it was, but it was huge and growled very loudly. I'd never heard anything like it before. And the stories my mum used to tell me didn't say anything about something like that either.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n\n<p>I heard steps in the next room this morning. I thought my mum had come to get me! So I ran to see, but I had to hide quickly behind the beer barrels because it wasn't my mum at all. The strange people walking around the Undersmithy were very scary. I really wonder where my mum and everyone else has gone.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n\n<p>All these days here have given me time to think about a lot of things. I accomplished my dream of visiting the depths of the Undersmithy! I think this experience has changed me a bit. I cooked for myself, and I've survived all this time without my mum's help. It's been hard, but I've learned a lot. Or maybe the hunger is getting to me and I'm starting to really lose my mind. But deep down, I don't think I regret it at all...</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n\n<p>I didn't sleep at all last night because the growling at the door came back. Even the last remaining rat fled the room. I think the monsters outside know that I'm there, and I don't dare go out or move at all. I won't make any noise and maybe they'll go away soon. I hope.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>Dear Diary,</p><br/>\n \n<p>The monsters outside have finally left. I'm very scared to leave, but I'm also very hungry.

As for crossing one's path... The few who are still alive rarely want to speak of it, out of fear that bad luck remembers that it forgot them along the way.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Yet, the viviper wasn't always associated with dark omens of death. The association dates back a time when the gods, arrogant and presumptuous, thought they could ignore the goddess of death.</p><br/> \n\n<p>Tikoltenak, the Crocodyl capital, often caught the attention of the divinities who enjoyed meeting there, prattling on and predicting their faithful followers' future battles and conquests. One evening, Ixchelonia, the goddess of the night, mused that the stars didn't have names and wondered why. The light of the stars would only shine fully once all the beings in the Archipelago of Scales could murmur their names.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Intrigued by this sudden declaration, the gods decided to meet the following month to make the stars into celestial bodies in their own right. They all received Ixchelonia's call. All of them, that is, except the Serpent Queen.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>In the morning, a pensive Ixchelonia withdrew under a sun that was slow in rising, while in the dark depths of the Crocodyl city, a laughing Huascaraknas was spinning her web. She was laughing because she knew which of the gods hadn't been invited to the evening's meeting. Huascaraknas spun a thread down to the depths of the city where she found Tanatekutli curled up in the damp.</p><br/>\n\n<p>Goddess of death, Tanatekutli is the Serpent Queen of the underground realm. She slithers day and night through the depths of her sinister kingdom. She knows every corner of it, every trickle of water, and every lost soul haunting the cold walls.</p><br/> \n\n<p>Huascaraknas slid along until she reached the sleeping goddess and smoothly whispered to her. She mentioned the meeting the gods had planned to name the stars and expressed false surprise when the Serpent Queen said she hadn't been informed of it. Huascaraknas chuckled as she threaded her way back up to the city and a dark fury took root in the hollows of Tanatekutli's scales.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p>In the evening, the Serpent Queen left her underground kingdom and slid her reptilian body to the top of Crocabulia's temple. Unaware of Tanatekutli's approaching fury, the gods were gazing at the stars. They were taking turns drawing the constellations that illuminated the inhabitants of the Archipelago of Scales every night. They drew twelve constellations in the dark sky.</p><br/>\n\n<p>When Tanatekutli reached the top of the Scaly Mother's temple, she saw that none of the constellations bore her mark. The powerful Serpent Queen unleashed her wrath on the other gods and drew a thirteenth constellation in the immense sky. And thus, from the pointy shape of the stars, Tanatekutli's serpentine children emerged.</p><br/> \n\n<p>Powerful venomous spotted vivipers appeared throughout the Archipelago of Scales. The Serpent Queen cursed everyone pretentious enough to dare forget her ever again. She swore that the terrifying threat of the vivipers' poison would forever prevent anyone from wiping Tanatekutli's name from their minds.</p><br/>\n\n<pagefeed/>\n\n<p><b>The Fountain of Youth</b></p><br/>\n\n<p>The bayou is home to many strange and mysterious tales and legends.

For many long years, this Crocodyl terrorised creatures throughout the Archipelago of Scales. But old age is a relentless enemy that slowly caught up to the Crocodyl, who became aware of the physical limits imposed upon him by age.</p><br/>\n<p>One sad night, the Crocodyl was struggling through the imposing mangrove when he came across a well that he'd ignored for many years. The Crocodyl bent down over the well and brought the water up to his mouth.</p>\n<pagefeed/>\n<p>It was a miracle! The Crocodyl's worn out and battered scales were replaced by solid, shiny scales. His teeth became sharp again, and little by little the Crocodyl recovered his past strength and vitality.</p><br/>\n<p>However, in his thirst for eternal youth, the Crocodyl drank the water from the spring throughout the night. In the morning, the Crocodyl bent over the endless spring and saw a strange reflection staring back at him. Realising that he'd shrunk to the size of a simple lizard, he became afraid and fled into the dark bayou.

I wonder if I shouldn't take a break and work on some other project for a while. Just to get some distance. Maybe then the solution will present itself to me on its own! A nobleman from Frigost, a certain Count Harebourg, has asked me to participate in the construction of a huge water clock. He wants me to supervise the creation of the liquid that will power it.

The Imp was quite the dirty spoiled brat, but he seems very skilled at handiwork. As for the last, Klume, Klime or something like that... Well, I don't think I've ever met anyone that twisted.

Or rather, she can't keep her eye off him, I should say, since the cold froze part of her face and left her with just one eye. She doesn't seem to have been very affected by the mutilation...
